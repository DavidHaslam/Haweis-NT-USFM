\cl CHAP. I.
\p
\v 1 THE book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
\p
\v 2 Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren,
\v 3 and Judas begat Phares, and Zara of Thamar, and Phares begat Esrom, and Esrom begat Aram;
\v 4 and Aram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Naasson, and Naasson begat Salmon,
\v 5 and Salmon begat Boaz of Rachab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse,
\v 6 and Jesse begat David the king, and David the king begat Solomon of her \add that had been the wife\add* of Urias,
\v 7 and Solomon begat Roboam, and Roboam begat Abia, and Abia begat Asa,
\v 8 and Asa begat Josaphat, and Josaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Ozias,
\v 9 and Ozias begat Joatham, and Joatham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekias,
\v 10 and Hezekias begat Manasses, and Manasses begat Amon, and Amon begat Josias,
\v 11 and Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon,
\v 12 and after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel, and Salathiel begat Zorobabel,
\v 13 and Zorobabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,
\v 14 and Azor begat Sadoc, and Sadoc begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,
\v 15 and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,
\v 16 and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom is born Jesus, who is called Christ.
\v 17 So all the generations from Abraham to David \add are\add* fourteen generations, and from David to the carrying away into Babylon fourteen generations, and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ fourteen generations.
\p
\v 18 Now the generation of Jesus Christ was attended with these circumstances: His mother Mary being betrothed to Joseph, before they cohabited together, she was found with child from the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 Then Joseph her husband being a just man, and not willing to expose her publicly, designed to put her away privately.
\v 20 And as he was revolving the matter in his mind, behold, an angel of the Lord in a dream appeared unto him, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take Mary for thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.
\v 22 Now the whole of this was done, that what was spoken of the Lord, by the prophet, might be fulfilled, saying\x + \xt Isa. vii. 14.\x*,
\v 23 “A virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel,” which is being interpreted, God with us.
\p
\v 24 Then Joseph when arisen from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife;
\v 25 and he knew her not, until she had brought forth her son, the first begotten, and he called his name Jesus.

\cl CHAP. II.
\p
\v 1 NOW when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, lo! Magians from the East came to Jerusalem,
\v 2 saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the East, and are come to pay him homage.
\p
\v 3 Now when Herod the king heard this, he was much agitated, and all Jerusalem with him.
\v 4 And assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he enquired of them, where the Messiah should be born.
\p
\v 5 Then they answered him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet\x + \xt Micah, v. 2.\x*,
\v 6 “And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, art in no respect the least amongst the princes of Judah, for from thee shall go forth the Ruler, who shall conduct my people Israel.”
\p
\v 7 Thereupon Herod secretly calling to him the Magians, enquired very particularly of them the time of the star’s appearing,
\v 8 and sending them to Bethlehem said, Go, and procure the most exact information respecting this child; and when you have found him, bring me intelligence, that I may come, and pay him homage also.
\p
\v 9 So having heard the king, they went on; and lo, the star, which they had seen in the East, had gone before them, till it came and stood over the place where the infant was.
\v 10 And when they saw the star, they were exceedingly transported with joy.
\v 11 And coming into the house, they found the infant with Mary his mother, and falling prostrate, they paid their homage to him. And opening their treasures, they made their offerings to him, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
\v 12 And having received warning in a dream not to go back to Herod, they departed into their own country by another road.
\p
\v 13 Now when they were gone, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the infant and his mother by night, and flee into Egypt, and stay there, till I speak to thee, for Herod will search for the infant to destroy it.
\v 14 So rising up, he took the babe and his mother by night, and retired into Egypt,
\v 15 and was there till the death of Herod; that what was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, might be fulfilled, saying\x + \xt Hos. ii. 1.\x*, “Out of Egypt have I called my son.”
\p
\v 16 Then Herod, perceiving that he was treated delusively by the Magians, was greatly exasperated, and he sent and slew all the male infants, that were in Bethlehem, and in all its territories, from their entering their second year and all under it, according to the time, which he had accurately enquired from the Magians.
\v 17 Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying\x + \xt Jer. xxxi. 15.\x*,
\v 18 “A cry was heard at Ramah, lamentation, and wailing, and bitter moaning, Rachel weeping for her children, and will not be comforted, because they are no more.”
\p
\v 19 Now when Herod was dead, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
\v 20 saying, Arise, and take the little boy and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they who sought the life of the infant are dead.
\v 21 So he arose, and took the child and his mother, and came unto the land of Israel.
\v 22 But hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judea in the stead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither. And being divinely warned in a dream, he retired into the country of Galilee,
\v 23 and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that what was said by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he shall be called a Nazarean.
\c 3
\cl CHAP. III.
\p
\v 1 THEN in those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the desert country of Judea,
\v 2 and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh.
\v 3 For this is the person spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying\x + \xt Isa. xl. 3.\x*, “The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths strait.”
\v 4 Now this John had his garment made of camel’s hair, and a girdle of leather about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
\p
\v 5 Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the regions about Jordan,
\v 6 and were baptized by him in Jordan, on making confession of their sins.
\v 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, O ye broods of vipers! who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\v 8 Produce then worthy fruits of repentance:
\v 9 and think not to say in yourselves, We have Abraham for our father: for I say unto you, that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
\v 10 And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees: every tree therefore which produceth not good fruit, is hewing down, and casting into the fire.
\v 11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with fire:
\v 12 whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will collect the wheat into his granary; but the chaff will he burn up with fire unquenchable.
\p
\v 13 Then came Jesus from Galilee unto Jordan to John, that he might be baptized by him.
\v 14 But John earnestly withheld him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
\v 15 But Jesus answering said unto him, Permit it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he permitted him.
\v 16 And Jesus, after his baptism, came straight from the water: and lo! the heavens were opened for him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as it were a dove, and coming upon him:
\v 17 and lo! a voice from the heavens, saying, This is my Son, the beloved, in whom is my delight.
\c 4
\cl CHAP. IV.
\p
\v 1 THEN was Jesus led away by the spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.
\v 2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he became hungry.
\v 3 And the tempter coming to him said, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made loaves.
\v 4 But he answering said, It is written\x + \xt Deut. viii. 3.\x*, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”
\p
\v 5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and placed him on a wing of the temple,
\v 6 and saith to him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written\x + \xt Psal. xci. 11, 12.\x*, “that he shall give his angels a charge concerning thee: and in their hands shall they hold thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.”
\v 7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again\x + \xt Deut. vi. 16.\x*, “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.”
\p
\v 8 Again the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory;
\v 9 and saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall prostrate and worship me.
\v 10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Avaunt Satan! for it is written\x + \xt Deut. vi. 13.\x*, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and to him only thou pay divine adoration.”
\v 11 Then the devil leaveth him, and lo! angels came and ministered unto him.
\p
\v 12 But when Jesus heard that John was cast into prison, he retired into Galilee;
\v 13 and leaving Nazareth, he came and resided at Capernaum, a maritime city, on the confines of Zebulun and Nephthali:
\v 14 that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, saying\x + \xt Isa. ix. 1, 2.\x*,
\v 15 “The land of Zabulun, and the land of Naphthali, the road to the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
\v 16 the people who sat in darkness saw a great light; and on those who sat in the region and shadow of death, even on them hath the light arisen.”
\p
\v 17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is approaching.
\p
\v 18 And as Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
\v 19 And he saith to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
\v 20 Then immediately quitting their nets they followed him.
\p
\v 21 And going on from thence, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
\v 22 Then they instantly quitting the ship and their father, followed him.
\p
\v 23 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every malady among the people.
\v 24 And there went out a report of him into all Syria: and they brought unto him all who had illness, the afflicted with various diseases and painful complaints, and the demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he healed them.
\v 25 And great multitudes followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond Jordan.
\c 5
\cl CHAP. V.
\p
\v 1 THEN seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain: and seating himself, his disciples came to him:
\v 2 and opening his mouth, he taught them, saying,
\p
\v 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit, for their’s is the kingdom of heaven.
\v 4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
\v 5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
\v 6 Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be fed to the full.
\v 7 Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
\v 8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
\v 9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
\v 10 Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake: for their’s is the kingdom in heaven.
\v 11 Blessed are ye, when they shall revile and persecute you, and lying, speak every thing evil against you for my sake.
\v 12 Rejoice and exult; for plenteous is your reward in the heavens: for just so they persecuted the prophets who went before you.
\p
\v 13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt become insipid, with what can it be salted? it is of no farther use for any purpose, but to be cast out, and trodden under foot of men.
\p
\v 14 Ye are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid that is situated on an eminence.
\v 15 Neither do men burn a lamp, and set it under a bushel, but on its stand; and it sheds light on all that are in the house.
\v 16 Just so let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.
\p
\v 17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law and the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil.
\v 18 For I tell you assuredly, that till heaven and earth pass away, not one iota, or the smallest stroke of a letter, shall pass from the law, until all things shall be accomplished.
\v 19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments, and teach men so, he shall be accounted the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall practise, and teach them, he shall be reckoned great in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness abounds more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 21 Ye have heard that it was said to the men of antient times, “Thou shalt do no murder;” and whosoever shall commit murder, shall be liable to the judgment:
\v 22 but I say unto you, That every man who is angry with his brother without cause, shall be liable to the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the sanhedrim: but whosever shall say, Thou fool, shall be liable to be cast into hell fire.
\v 23 If therefore thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;
\v 24 leave there thy gift before the altar, and go: first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
\v 25 Be disposed to agree with thy prosecutor speedily, whilst thou art in the way with him \add to the bar\add*; lest the prosecutor deliver thee up to the judge, and the judge commit thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
\v 26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt in no wise come out from thence, till thou hast paid the last farthing.
\p
\v 27 Ye have heard that it was said to those of old, “Thou shalt not commit adultery:”
\v 28 but I say unto you, That every one who looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.
\v 29 If then thine eye, the right, leads thee to offend, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is highly for thy advantage, that one of thy members be destroyed, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
\v 30 And if thy right hand leads thee to offend, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is highly thy interest that one of thy members should be destroyed, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
\p
\v 31 It hath been said indeed, That whosoever will put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce:
\v 32 But I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except on account of whoredom, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is put away, committeth adultery.
\p
\v 33 Again ye have heard that it was said to those of old, “Thou shalt not perjure thyself, but shalt perform to the Lord thine oaths:”
\v 34 But I say to thee, Swear not at all; neither by the heaven; for it is the throne of God:
\v 35 nor by the earth; for it is the footstool of his feet: nor by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King:
\v 36 neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black.
\v 37 But let your discourse be, Yea, yea; No, no: for all addition to these is from the wicked one.
\p
\v 38 Ye have heard that it was said, “Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth:”
\v 39 but I say unto you, Resist not an injurious act; but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him also the other.
\v 40 And if a man will prosecute thee, and take thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.
\v 41 And whosoever shall press thee for one mile, go with him two.
\v 42 Give to him that asketh thee; and from him who wants to borrow of thee, turn not away.
\p
\v 43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.”
\v 44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who treat you insolently, and persecute you;
\v 45 that ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven: for he causeth his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and tendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
\v 46 For if ye love those who love you, what reward have you? do not even the publicans the same thing?
\v 47 And if ye embrace your brethren only, what do ye extraordinary? do not even the publicans so?
\v 48 Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.
\c 6
\cl CHAP. VI.
\p
\v 1 TAKE heed that ye do not your alms before men, in order to catch their eye: for otherwise ye have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
\v 2 Therefore when thou givest alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues, and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Verily I say unto you, They receive their reward.
\v 3 But when thou givest alms, let not thy right hand know what thy left is doing:
\v 4 that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret, will himself reward thee openly.
\p
\v 5 And when thou prayest, be not as the hypocrites: for they love standing in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, to pray, that they may make a shew to men. Verily I say unto you, That they have their reward.
\v 6 But when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and shut thy door, to pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
\v 7 And when thou art at prayer, use not vain repetitions, like the heathen: for they imagine that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
\v 8 Be not ye therefore like them: for your Father knoweth of what things ye have need, before you ask him.
\v 9 Thus then pray ye: Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
\v 10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
\v 11 Give us this day our daily bread.
\v 12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
\v 13 And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil: for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen!
\v 14 For if ye forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
\v 15 but if ye forgive not to men their offences, neither will your Father forgive your offences.
\p
\v 16 And when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, affecting a gloomy look: for they disfigure their visages, that they may make a shew of fasting to men. Verily I say unto you, That they have their reward.
\v 17 But when thou keepest a fast, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
\v 18 that thou mayest not make a shew of fasting to men, but to thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
\p
\v 19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where the rust and canker spoil, and where thieves dig through and steal:
\v 20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither rust nor canker spoil, and where thieves do not dig through and steal;
\v 21 for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
\p
\v 22 The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be transparent, thy whole body shall be enlightened.
\v 23 But if thine eye be vitiated, thy whole body will be darkened. If therefore the light which is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
\p
\v 24 No man can serve two masters: for he will either hate the one, and love the other; or he will adhere to the one, and disregard the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
\v 25 For this cause I tell you, Be not anxious about your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life of more value than meat, and the body than raiment?
\v 26 Look on the birds of the air: for they neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are you not of more value than they?
\v 27 But which of you, by his cares, can add one cubit to his stature?
\v 28 And why are ye anxious about clothing? Contemplate the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, nor spin:
\v 29 yet I tell you, Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.
\v 30 If God then so clothe a vegetable of the field, which to-day is, \add in beauty\add*, and tomorrow is cast into the furnace, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
\v 31 Wherefore be under no anxiety, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?
\v 32 (for after all these things the heathen seek:) and your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of them all.
\v 33 But seek ye, in the first place, the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be given you over.
\v 34 Be not therefore anxious about to-morrow: for tomorrow will provide for its own wants. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.
\c 7
\cl CHAP. VII.
\p
\v 1 JUDGE not, that ye be not judged.
\v 2 For with the same judgment ye judge others, shall ye be judged: and with the measure ye mete, shall it be measured to you again.
\v 3 And why spiest thou out the mote which is in thy brother’s eye, yet payest no attention to the beam which is in thine own eye?
\v 4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Suffer me to take the mote off from thine eye: and behold there is a beam in thine own eye?
\v 5 Thou hypocrite, take first the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to take off the mote from thy brother’s eye.
\p
\v 6 Give not that which is holy to dogs, nor cast pearls before swine; lest they tread them under foot, and turning round tear you.
\p
\v 7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
\v 8 for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
\v 9 What man is there of you, of whom if his son ask a loaf, will he give him a stone?
\v 10 or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
\v 11 If ye then, evil as ye are, know how to bestow good gifts on your children; how much more will your Father who is in heaven, bestow good things on those who ask him?
\v 12 All things therefore whatsoever ye would be willing that men should do to you, just so do ye to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
\p
\v 13 Enter in through the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and spacious the road, which leadeth to perdition, and they are many who enter that way:
\v 14 because strait is the gate, and narrow the road, which leadeth to life, and they are but a few who find it.
\p
\v 15 Take heed then of false prophets, who come to you in the garb of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
\v 16 By their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather a bunch of grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
\v 17 So every good tree beareth good fruits; but every bad tree in kind, produceth bad fruits.
\v 18 A good tree cannot produce bad fruits, neither can a tree bad in kind produce good fruits.
\v 19 Every tree that beareth not good fruit, is cut down, and cast into the fire.
\v 20 Well then! by their fruits ye shall know them.
\v 21 Not every one who saith to me, Lord, Lord! shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.
\v 22 Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have we not cast out devils? and in thy name done many miracles?
\v 23 And then will I profess unto them, that I never knew you: depart from me, ye workers of iniquity.
\p
\v 24 Every man therefore who is hearing from me these words, and puts them in practice, I will compare him to the intelligent man, who erected his house upon a rock:
\v 25 and the rain descended, and the rivers rushed, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house, and it fell not; for it was founded on a rock.
\v 26 And every man who is hearing these sayings of mine, and doth not practise them, he will resemble the foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:
\v 27 and the rain descended, and the rivers rushed, and the winds blew, and set against that house, and it fell; and the fall of it was great.
\p
\v 28 And it was so, that when Jesus had concluded all these sayings, the multitudes were exceedingly struck with his teaching:
\v 29 for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
\c 8
\cl CHAP. VIII.
\p
\v 1 NOW when he descended from the mount, great multitudes followed him.
\v 2 And lo! a leper came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
\v 3 And stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And instantly the leprosy was cleansed.
\v 4 And Jesus said to him, See thou tell no man; but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded for a testimony unto them.
\p
\v 5 Then as Jesus was entering into Capernaum, there met him a centurion, intreating him,
\v 6 and saying, My servant is lying in the house paralytic, terribly tormented with pain.
\v 7 And Jesus said unto him, I will come and heal him.
\v 8 And the centurion said, I am not a fit person, that thou shouldest come under my roof: but only speak a word, and my servant be cured.
\v 9 For I also am a man under authority, having under my command soldiers and I say to this soldier, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
\v 10 And Jesus hearing him, marvelled, and said to those who were following, Verily I say unto you, not even in Israel have I found so great faith.
\v 11 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 12 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast into the outer darkness: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
\v 13 And Jesus said to the centurion, Go; and as thou hast believed, be it to thee. And his servant was cured at that very hour.
\p
\v 14 And when Jesus was come into the house of Peter, he saw his mother-in-law laid on a bed, and in a fever.
\v 15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and waited upon them.
\p
\v 16 And when evening was come, they brought him many possessed by devils: and he cast out the spirits by a word, and all who had illnesses he cured:
\v 17 that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet, “Himself he took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.”
\p
\v 18 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave orders to pass to the other side.
\v 19 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
\v 20 And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where he can lay his head.
\v 21 And another of his disciples said unto him, Permit me first to go and bury my father.
\v 22 And Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their own dead.
\p
\v 23 And going on board a vessel, his disciples followed him.
\v 24 And, behold, there was a great tempest in the sea, so that the vessel was hid by the waves; but he was asleep.
\v 25 And his disciples coming, awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we are perishing!
\v 26 And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then arising, he issued his mandate to the winds, and to the sea; and there was a great calm.
\v 27 And the men marvelled, saying, What a wondrous man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
\v 28 And when he came to the other side, into the region of the Girgasenes, there met him two demoniacs, coming from the sepulchres; exceeding fierce, so that no person was able to pass by that road.
\v 29 And lo! they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither before the time to torment us?
\v 30 And at a considerable distance, there was a great herd of swine feeding.
\v 31 Then the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, permit us to go into the herd of swine.
\v 32 And he said to them, Go. Then they going forth out \add of him\add*, entered into the herd of swine: and lo! the whole herd of the swine rushed down a precipice into the sea, and perished in the waters.
\v 33 But they who fed them fled, and going away into the city, reported all things, and what had happened to the demoniacs.
\v 34 And, behold, all the city came out to meet him: and when they saw him, they besought him to depart from their territories.

\p
\v 1 AND going on board the vessel, he passed over, and came to his own city.
\v 2 And lo! they brought him a paralytic stretched on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic, Be of good cheer, son; thy sins are forgiven thee.
\v 3 And lo! some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.
\v 4 And Jesus, seeing their thoughts, said, wherefore do ye imagine evil things in your hearts?
\v 5 For which is the easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?
\v 6 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority upon earth to forgive sins, (then he saith to the paralytic,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.
\v 7 And he arose, and went to his house.
\v 8 But when the multitude saw it, they were astonished, and glorified God, who had given such power unto men.
\p
\v 9 And Jesus passing from thence, saw a man sitting at the custom house, called Matthew: and saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
\v 10 And it came to pass, as he sat in his house, many tax-gatherers and sinners came, and sat down at table with Jesus and his disciples.
\v 11 And the Pharisees observing it, said to his disciples, How is this, that your Master eateth with publicans and sinners?
\v 12 But Jesus hearing it, said unto them, They who are in the vigour of health have no need of the physician, but they who have illness.
\v 13 Go then, and learn what is said, “I require mercy and not sacrifice:” for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\p
\v 14 Then came unto him disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees keep many fasts, but thy disciples fast not?
\v 15 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber weep, whilst the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast.
\v 16 But no man ingrafts a patch of undressed cloth into an old garment, for the piece supplied taketh from the garment, and the rent becomes worse.
\v 17 Nor do they put new wine into old bottles: but if they do, the bottles burst, and the wine is spilt, and the bottles are destroyed: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.
\p
\v 18 As he was speaking these things to them, behold, there came a ruler, and prostrated himself before him, saying, My daughter hath just now died: but come and lay thine hand upon her, and she shall live.
\v 19 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and his disciples also.
\v 20 And, behold, a woman, who had an haemorrage twelve years, came behind, and touched the fringe of his garment:
\v 21 for she said within herself, If I only touch his garment, I shall be cured.
\v 22 Then Jesus, turning about and beholding her, said, Be encouraged, daughter; thy faith hath saved thee. And the woman was cured from that hour.
\v 23 And when Jesus was come into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute-players, and a multitude confusedly lamenting,
\v 24 he saith to them, Retire; for the little girl is not dead, but sleeping. And they derided him.
\v 25 So when the multitude was put out, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the little girl arose.
\v 26 And the fame of it went forth into all that country.
\p
\v 27 And as Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, son of David!
\v 28 So when he came into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus said to them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yes, Lord.
\v 29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.
\v 30 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, Take care that no person know it.
\v 31 But they going forth, blazoned his fame through all that country.
\p
\v 32 And when they were coming out, behold, they brought unto him a man, dumb, a demoniac.
\v 33 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb man spoke: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, Never at any time was the like to this seen in Israel.
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, By the prince of the devils doth he cast the devils out.
\p
\v 35 And Jesus took a circuit through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease, and every malady among the people.
\v 36 And beholding the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were fainting, and lying here and there, as sheep that had no shepherd.
\v 37 Then said he to his disciples, The harvest indeed is abundant, but the labourers are few;
\v 38 entreat therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth workmen for his harvest.
\c 10
\cl CHAP. X.
\p
\v 1 AND having called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to cure every disease, and every malady.
\v 2 Now these are the names of the twelve apostles; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
\v 3 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax-gatherer; James son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, whose surname is Thaddeus;
\v 4 Simon the Cananite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
\p
\v 5 These twelve did Jesus send forth, commanding them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter not:
\v 6 but go rather to the sheep that are lost of the house of Israel.
\v 7 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is approaching.
\v 8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.
\v 9 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,
\v 10 nor a scrip for the journey, nor two coats, nor sandals, nor stick: for the workman is worthy of his food.
\v 11 And into whatsoever city or village ye enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye depart.
\v 12 And when ye come into a family, salute it:
\v 13 and if the family shall be deserving, your peace shall come upon it: and if it be not deserving, your peace shall return to you.
\v 14 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor attend to your discourses, go out of that house, or city, and shake off the dust of your feet.
\v 15 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
\p
\v 16 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore prudent as serpents, and harmless as doves.
\v 17 But be on your guard against men: for they will deliver you up to the sanhedrim, and scourge you in their synagogues.
\v 18 And ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the heathen.
\v 19 But when they shall deliver you up, be under no anxiety what ye shall say; for it shall be given you in that very hour what ye should speak:
\v 20 for it is not you who are speaking, but the Spirit of your Father which is speaking in you.
\v 21 Then brother shall surrender brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
\v 22 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end, that man shall be saved.
\p
\v 23 But when they shall persecute you in one city, flee unto another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not complete your circuit through the cities of Israel before the Son of man comes.
\v 24 The disciple is not superior to his teacher, nor the servant above his master.
\v 25 It is sufficient if the disciple be as his teacher, and the servant as his master. If they have called the master of the family Beelzebub, how much more his domestics?
\v 26 However, fear them not: for there is nothing concealed, which shall not be discovered; nor hid, which shall not be known.
\v 27 What I say unto you in the dark, publish in the light: and what ye hear whispered into the ear, proclaim upon the roofs.
\p
\v 28 And be not afraid of those who kill the body, and cannot kill the soul: but fear him rather who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
\v 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father.
\v 30 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
\v 31 Fear not, therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
\p
\v 32 Every one therefore who shall make confession of me before men, of him will I also make confession before my Father who is in heaven.
\v 33 But whosoever shall disown me before men, him will I also disown before my Father who is in heaven.
\p
\v 34 Think not that I am come to bring peace to the earth: I came not to bring peace, but a sword.
\v 35 For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
\v 36 And the enemies of a man shall be those of his own house.
\v 37 He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.
\v 38 And he that taketh not up his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.
\p
\v 39 He that preserveth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall preserve it.
\v 40 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
\v 41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive the reward of a prophet; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive the reward of a righteous man.
\v 42 And whosoever shall give to one of these little ones, if but a cup of cold water to drink, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

\p
\v 1 AND it came to pass, when Jesus had finished his injunctions to his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities.
\p
\v 2 Then John, having heard in prison the works of Christ, sent two of his disciples,
\v 3 and said unto him, Art thou he that cometh, or should we expect another?
\v 4 And Jesus answering said unto them, Go, and tell John what things ye hear and see.
\v 5 The blind receive sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
\v 6 And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended at me.
\p
\v 7 And when they were gone, Jesus began to speak to the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
\v 8 But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in delicate garments? Lo! they who wear delicate garments are in the houses of kings.
\v 9 Yet what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and abundantly more than a prophet.
\v 10 For this is he of whom it is written, “Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.”
\v 11 Verily I say unto you, There hath not arisen, from those born of women, a greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
\v 12 But from the days of John the Baptist unto the present, the kingdom of heaven is assaulted by violence, and the invaders forcibly seize upon it.
\v 13 For all the prophets and the law until John, foretold \add this\add*.
\v 14 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias who was to come.
\v 15 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\p
\v 16 But to whom shall I resemble this generation? it is like little boys sitting in the places of concourse, and calling to their companions,
\v 17 and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have sung mournful ditties to you, and ye have not beat your breasts.
\v 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil:
\v 19 the Son of man is come eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, what a man! a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners: though wisdom hath been justified by her children.
\p
\v 20 Then began he to upbraid the cities in which the chief of his miracles had been wrought, because they repented not:
\v 21 Wo unto thee, Chorazin! wo unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the miracles which had been wrought in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, long since would they have repented in sack-cloth and ashes.
\v 22 Wherefore I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.
\v 23 And thou, Capernaum, who hast been exalted unto heaven, shalt be cast down to hell: for if the miracles which have been wrought in thee had been done in Sodom, it had remained unto this day.
\v 24 Wherefore I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee.
\p
\v 25 At that time Jesus spake and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and the intelligent, and hast revealed them to babes:
\v 26 yes, Father! since such is thy good pleasure.
\v 27 All things are delivered up to me by my Father: and no person knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any person the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal him.
\p
\v 28 Come to me, all who labour hard, and sustain heavy burdens, and I will give you relief.
\v 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest to your souls.
\v 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
\c 12
\cl CHAP. XII.
\p
\v 1 AT that time Jesus walked through corn-fields on a sabbath-day; and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.
\v 2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, Behold, thy disciples do a thing that it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.
\v 3 And he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they who were with him?
\v 4 how they went into the house of God, and did eat the loaves of shew-bread, of which it was not lawful for him or those who were with him to eat, but for the priests alone?
\v 5 Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are not culpable?
\v 6 Now I tell you, That one greater than the temple is here.
\v 7 But if ye had known what that meant, I desire mercy and not sacrifice; ye would not have condemned the innocent.
\v 8 For the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
\p
\v 9 And going on from thence, he came into their synagogue;
\v 10 and, behold a man was there who had a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on sabbath days? that they might accuse him.
\v 11 Then he said to them; What man of you is there who hath one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath, doth he not lay hold on him, and lift him out?
\v 12 Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath days.
\v 13 Then saith he to the man, Stretch out thy hand; and he stretched it out, and it was restored, sound as the other.
\p
\v 14 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a consultation against him, how they might make away with him.
\v 15 But Jesus knew it, and retired from thence, and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all,
\v 16 and charged them that they should not make him known.
\v 17 That what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
\v 18 “Behold, my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul delighteth: I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall proclaim judgment for the heathen.
\v 19 He shall not contend, nor be clamorous; neither shall any man in the streets hear his voice.
\v 20 A bruised reed shall he not break down, and smoking flax shall he not quench, until he break forth in judgment for victory.
\v 21 And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.”
\p
\v 22 Then was brought to him a demoniac, blind and dumb; and he cured him, so as to enable the blind and dumb both to speak and see.
\v 23 And all the multitudes were lost in amazement, and they said, Is not this the son of David?
\v 24 But the Pharisees hearing them, said, This fellow casteth not out devils, but by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.
\v 25 But Jesus knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself will be desolated; and every city, or family, divided against itself cannot subsist:
\v 26 so if Satan cast out Satan; he is divided against himself; how then can his kingdom subsist?
\v 27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
\v 28 But if I by the Spirit of God cast out the devils, then truly the kingdom of God is come unto you.
\v 29 Else how can one enter into a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, except he first bind the strong man, and then will he plunder his goods?
\v 30 He that is not with me, is against me; and he that associates not with me, scattereth abroad.
\v 31 Therefore I say unto you, All sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven to men.
\v 32 And whosoever may speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.
\v 33 Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by the fruit.
\v 34 Ye broods of vipers, how can ye speak good things, yourselves being wicked? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
\v 35 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things: and a wicked man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth evil things.
\v 36 But I tell you, That every idle word which men speak, for it shall they give an account in the day of judgment.
\v 37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
\p
\v 38 Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees addressed him, saying, Master, we desire to see a sign from thee.
\v 39 But he answered and said unto them, A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh a sign; and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet:
\v 40 for as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights; so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
\v 41 The men of Nineveh shall rise up in judgment against this generation, and condemn it: for they repented on the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
\v 42 The queen of the South shall rise up in judgment against the men of this generation, and condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
\p
\v 43 When the unclean spirit is indeed gone out of a man, he traverses through places destitute of water, in search of rest, but cannot find it.
\v 44 Then he saith, I will return to my mansion, whence I came; and on his arrival, he findeth it unoccupied, swept, and furnished.
\v 45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this wicked generation.
\p
\v 46 And while he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak to him.
\v 47 And a person said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak to thee.
\v 48 But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
\v 49 And stretching out his hand towards his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren.
\v 50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

\cl CHAP. XIII.
\p
\v 1 THEN the same day Jesus going out from the house, sat down near the sea.
\v 2 And vast multitudes were gathered together unto him, insomuch that he entered into a vessel to be seated; and all the multitude stood on the beach.
\v 3 And he spake unto them many things in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went out to sow:
\v 4 and as he was sowing, some seeds fell indeed by the road-side; and the birds came and ate them up:
\v 5 and other seed fell on a rocky soil, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
\v 6 and when the sun arose, it was scorched up; and because it had no root, it withered away.
\v 7 And other seeds fell among the thorns; and the thorns sprang up and choked them:
\v 8 but others fell on good ground, and produced fruit, some an hundred, some sixty, and some thirty.
\v 9 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\v 10 And when his disciples came, they said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?
\v 11 And he answered and said unto them, Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
\v 12 For whosoever hath, more shall be given to him, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, even that he hath shall be taken from him.
\v 13 Therefore I speak to them in parables: that seeing, they may not see; and hearing, they may not hear nor understand.
\v 14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, With the hearing ye shall hear, and not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and in no wise perceive:
\v 15 for the heart of this people is waxed gross, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with the eves, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
\v 16 But blessed are your eyes; for ye see: and your ears; for ye hear.
\v 17 For verily I tell you, That many prophets and righteous men have greatly desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard them.
\v 18 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
\p
\v 19 When any person heareth the word of the kingdom, and doth not understand it, the wicked one cometh, and snatcheth away what was sown on his heart: such is he who is the sown by the road-side.
\v 20 But the sown on the rocky soil, is he who having heard the word, and instantly with joy receiving it,
\v 21 hath not really root in himself, but is merely temporary: and when tribulation or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately he is stumbled.
\v 22 But the sown among the thorns, is he who heareth the word, and the anxiety about this world and the deceitfulness of riches, choketh the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
\v 23 But the sown upon the good ground, is he who heareth the word, and understandeth it; who truly beareth fruit, and produceth, one an hundred fold, and another sixty, and another thirty.
\p
\v 24 Another parable proposed he to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man who sowed good seed in his field:
\v 25 and while the men were asleep, his enemy came and sowed zizane among the wheat, and departed.
\v 26 But when the blade was shot up, and produced fruit, then appeared also the zizane.
\v 27 The servants of the proprietor came, and said to him, Master, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it the zizane?
\v 28 He saith unto them, Some man, an enemy, hath done this. Then the servants said to him, Wilt thou that we go and weed them out?
\v 29 he replied, No; lest perhaps in weeding out the zizane, we root up the wheat with them.
\v 30 Let them both grow together till the harvest: and at the harvest-time I will say to the reapers, Gather out first the zizane, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
\p
\v 31 Another parable he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard, which a man took and sowed in his field:
\v 32 which indeed is among the smallest of all seeds; but when it is grown, it is among the greatest of herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make their nests in the branches of it.
\p
\v 33 Another parable spake he to them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and covered up in three measures of flour, until the whole was leavened.
\v 34 All these things spake Jesus in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable he spake not to them:
\v 35 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables, I will bring forth things hid from the foundation of the world.
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus dismissing the multitudes, went into a house; and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the zizane of the field.
\v 37 And he replying said to them, He that sowed the good seed, is the Son of man;
\v 38 the field is the world: and the good seed are those who are the children of the kingdom; but the zizane are the children of the wicked one;
\v 39 the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
\v 40 As therefore the zizane are gathered, and burned in the fire; just so shall it be at the end of this world.
\v 41 The Son of man shall send out his angels, and shall gather together out of his kingdom all things offensive, and those who practise iniquity;
\v 42 and will cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
\v 43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\p
\v 44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hid in a field: which when a man findeth, he hideth, and for joy thereof, goeth away and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
\p
\v 45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchantman in search of beautiful pearls:
\v 46 who, having discovered one of vast price, went away and sold all that he possessed, and bought it.
\p
\v 47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a net cast into the sea, and colleting fish of every kind:
\v 48 which, when it was full, they drew to the beach, and sitting down, selected the good into baskets, but cast those of a bad kind away.
\v 49 Just so shall it be at the end of this world: the angels shall go forth, and shall separate the wicked from amidst the just,
\v 50 and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\v 51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
\v 52 They say unto him, Yes, Lord. Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe instructed unto the kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man, the master of a family, who bringeth out of his storehouse things new and old.
\p
\v 53 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished there parables, he departed thence.
\v 54 And coming into his own country, taught them in their synagogues, so that they were exceedingly struck, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these miracles?
\v 55 Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
\v 56 and his sisters, are they not all among us? whence then hath he all these things?
\v 57 And they were offended at him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not disrespected, except in his own country, and in his own family.
\v 58 And he did not there many miracles because of their unbelief.

\v 1 AT that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report of Jesus,
\v 2 and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead, and therefore miracles are wrought by him.
\v 3 For Herod having seized John, had bound him, and put him in prison, for the sake of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
\v 4 For John said unto him, It is unlawful for thee to have her.
\v 5 And though he wished to kill him, he was afraid of the multitude, for they held him as a prophet.
\v 6 But when Herod’s birth-day was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced in the circle, and pleased Herod:
\v 7 so that with an oath he promised to give her whatever she should ask.
\v 8 And she, being previously urged on by her mother, said, Give me here, in a spacious dish, the head of John the Baptist.
\v 9 And the king was grieved: but for his oath’s sake, and on account of those who were with him, he commanded it to be given her.
\v 10 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
\v 11 And his head was brought on a large dish, and was given to the young lady: and she brought it to her mother.
\v 12 And his disciples came and took the body, and buried it, and they came and told Jesus.
\v 13 And when Jesus heard it, he withdrew from thence in a vessel into a desert place apart: and when the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.
\p
\v 14 And when Jesus was come forth, he saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion towards them, and healed their sick.
\v 15 But when evening was come, his disciples came unto him, saying, The place is desert, and the day is far advanced; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves provisions.
\v 16 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart: give ye them to eat.
\v 17 And they said unto him, We have nothing here except five loaves and two fishes.
\v 18 Then he said, Bring them hither to me.
\v 19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
\v 20 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up the superabundance of the fragments, twelve baskets full.
\v 21 And they who had eaten, were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
\v 22 And immediately Jesus compelled his disciples to go on board the vessel, and pass before him to the other side, while he dismissed the people.
\p
\v 23 And when he had sent away the multitude, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when evening came, he was there alone.
\v 24 But the vessel was already in the midst of the sea, tossed with the waves: for the wind was contrary.
\v 25 Then at the fourth watch of the night came Jesus unto them, walking on the sea.
\v 26 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were greatly agitated, saying, It is his apparition. And they cried out with terror.
\v 27 And immediately Jesus spake to them, saying, Be of good courage: it is I; be not terrified.
\v 28 Then Peter answering, said, Lord, if it be thou, command me to come unto thee upon the waters.
\v 29 And he said, Come. And descending from the vessel, Peter walked upon the waters to come to Jesus.
\v 30 But seeing the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink in the deep, he cried out, saying, Lord save me.
\v 31 Then immediately Jesus stretching out his hand, laid hold on him, and said to him, O thou of little faith, wherefore dost thou doubt?
\v 32 And when they came aboard the vessel, the wind ceased.
\v 33 And they who were in the vessel, came and worshipped him, saying, Truly thou art the Son of God.
\p
\v 34 And passing over, they came to the land of Gennesareth.
\v 35 And when the men of that place knew him, they sent into all that neighbourhood, and brought to him all that had illnesses:
\v 36 and they besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment: and as many as touched it were cured.

\cl CHAP. XV.
\p
\v 1 THEN came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem, saying,
\v 2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread?
\v 3 And he answering said to them, And why do you transgress the command of God, by your tradition?
\v 4 For God commanded, saying “Honour thy father and thy mother:” and, He that curseth father or mother, let him surely die.
\v 5 But ye say, If any man declare to his father or mother, This is a \add devoted\add* gift, which else might have been employed by me for thy advantage;
\v 6 then he shall not with it honour his father and mother: so have ye vacated the command of God by your tradition.
\v 7 Ye hypocrites, well hath Isaiah prophesied concerning you, saying,
\v 8 This people draweth nigh to me with their mouths, and honoureth me with the lips, but their heart is far distant from me.
\v 9 But in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines the commandments of men.
\v 10 And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
\v 11 not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but what cometh out of the mouth, that defileth the man.
\p
\v 12 Then his disciples approaching, said to him, Knowest thou how offended the Pharisees were at hearing that speech?
\v 13 Then he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.
\v 14 Leave them to themselves: they are blind leaders of the blind. But if the blind lead the blind, they will both fall into the pit.
\v 15 Then Peter answering said unto him, Explain to us this parable.
\v 16 And Jesus said, Are ye also to this time destitute of intelligence?
\v 17 Do ye not observe, that every thing which entereth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is ejected into the vault?
\v 18 But the things which go forth out of the mouth, come out of the heart, and they are the things which defile a man:
\v 19 for out of the heart proceed wicked reasonings, murders, adulteries, whoredoms, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies:
\v 20 these are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashed hands doth not defile a man.
\p
\v 21 And going forth thence, Jesus retired into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
\v 22 And lo! a woman of Canaan coming out of these coasts, cried aloud, saying to him, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David: my daughter is a grievous demoniac.
\v 23 But he replied not a word to her. Then his disciples came and intreated him, saying, Send her away; for she is crying aloud after us.
\v 24 But he said in reply, I am not sent, save only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\v 25 Then she came, and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me!
\v 26 But he answering said, It is not proper to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.
\v 27 And she said, True, Lord: yet even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master’s table.
\v 28 Then Jesus answering said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith! be it unto thee even as thou desirest. And her daughter was cured from that hour.
\p
\v 29 And departing thence, Jesus went to the sea-side of Galilee; and ascending a mountain, he sat down there.
\v 30 And great multitudes came to him, bringing with them the lame, blind, dumb, cripples, and many others, and cast them down at the feet of Jesus; and he cured them all:
\v 31 insomuch that the multitude marvelled when they saw the dumb speaking, the cripples sound, the lame walking, and the blind restored to sight: and they glorified the God of Israel.
\p
\v 32 Then Jesus calling his disciples, said, I have compassion on the multitude, for they have now continued with me three days, and have not any thing to eat: and send them away fasting I will not, lest they faint on the road.
\v 33 And his disciples said unto him, Whence can we in the wilderness have loaves enough to satisfy the cravings of so great a multitude?
\v 34 And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.
\v 35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
\v 36 And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, he gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
\v 37 And they did all eat, and were filled: and took up a superabundance of fragments seven baskets full.
\v 38 And they that had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.
\v 39 And dismissing the multitudes he went on board a vessel, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
\c 16
\cl CHAP. XVI.
\p
\v 1 AND the Pharisees and the Sadducees came to him, and, to make trial of him, desired him to shew them a sign from heaven.
\v 2 And he answering, said unto them, When evening comes, ye say, Fair weather, for the sky is red.
\v 3 And in the morning, It will be tempestuous to-day, for the sky is gloomy and fiery red. Ye hypocrites, do ye know how to discern the appearance of the sky, and are ye unable to discern the signs of the times?
\v 4 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh a sign; and no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah. And he left them, and departed.
\p
\v 5 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
\v 6 Then Jesus said to them, Beware and abstain from the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
\v 7 So they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have not taken bread.
\v 8 But when Jesus knew it, he said unto them, Why are ye reasoning among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye have not taken bread?
\v 9 Do you not consider, nor remember the five loaves among the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
\v 10 Nor the seven loaves among the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
\v 11 How is it that ye do not understand, that I spake not to you of bread, to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
\v 12 Then understood they, that he spake about abstaining not from the leaven in the bread, but from the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
\p
\v 13 Then Jesus coming into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, questioned his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I am? The Son of Man?
\v 14 But they replied, Some, that thou art John the Baptist; but others, Elias; and others again, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
\v 15 He saith unto them, But who do ye say that I am?
\v 16 Then Simon Peter answering said, Thou art the Messiah, the Son of the living God.
\v 17 And Jesus replying, said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed this to thee, but my Father, who is in heaven.
\v 18 And I tell thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
\v 19 And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\v 20 Then he commanded his disciples, that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Messiah.
\p
\v 21 From that time Jesus began to shew his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders, and of the chief-priests, and of the scribes, and be put to death, and the third day rise again.
\v 22 And Peter taking him aside, began to chide him, saying, Mercy on thee, Lord! this shall never be thy case.
\v 23 Then turning from him, he said unto Peter, Get thee behind me Satan! thou art an offence to me: for thou dost not relish the things of God, but those of men.
\p
\v 24 Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
\v 25 For whosoever is desirous to preserve his life, shall lose it; but whosoever would lose his life for my sake, shall find it.
\v 26 For what would a man be advantaged, though he could gain the whole world, if he should suffer the loss of his soul? or what will a man give as the ransom for his soul?
\v 27 For the Son of man shall hereafter come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then shall he recompense every man according to his practice.
\v 28 Verily I say unto you, There are some of those standing here, who shall in no wise taste of death, until they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

\p
\v 1 THEN six days after, Jesus taketh Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them into an exceeding high mountain apart.
\v 2 And he was transformed before them; and his face shone as the sun, and his garments were white as the light.
\v 3 And behold, there appeared to them, Moses and Elias talking with him.
\v 4 Then Peter addressing him, said to Jesus, Lord, It is well that we are here; if it please thee, we will make here three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
\v 5 And while he was yet speaking, behold, a luminous cloud overshadowed them; and lo! a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom is my delight; hear him!
\v 6 And the disciples hearing it, fell on their face, and were exceedingly affrighted.
\v 7 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, be not affrighted.
\v 8 Then lifting up their eyes, they saw no person, but Jesus only.
\v 9 And when they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell no man the vision, until the Son of man is risen from the dead.
\v 10 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then do the scribes affirm, that Elias must come first?
\v 11 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Elias indeed cometh first, and will reform all things.
\v 12 But I say unto you, That Elias is already come, and they knew him not, but have done by him whatsoever they chose: even so also must the Son of man suffer by them.
\v 13 Then understood the disciples that he spake to them of John the Baptist.
\p
\v 14 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling down to him, and saying,
\v 15 Lord, have compassion on my son, for he is a lunatic, and suffers grievously; for oftentimes he falleth into the fire, and often into the water.
\v 16 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they have not been able to cure him.
\v 17 Then Jesus answering, said, O generation, faithless, and perverse! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him hither to me.
\v 18 And Jesus rebuked him, and the devil came out of him; and the child was cured from that hour.
\v 19 Then the disciples of Jesus coming privately, said, Why could not we cast it out?
\v 20 Then said Jesus unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall say to this mountain, Remove from hence, thither, and it will remove; and nothing will be impossible for you.
\v 21 But this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
\p
\v 22 And as they were returning into Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of men:
\v 23 and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. And they were grieved exceedingly.
\p
\v 24 And when they came to Capernaum, they who receive the tax of two drachmas came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?
\v 25 He saith, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth receive customs and tax? from their own children, or from aliens?
\v 26 Peter saith to him, From aliens. Jesus saith unto him, In that case then the children are free.
\v 27 But that we give them no offence, go unto the sea, and cast in a hook, and take the first fish which cometh up; and on opening his mouth, thou wilt find a stater, that take and give them for me and thee.
\c 18
\cl CHAP. XVIII.
\p
\v 1 AT that time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is indeed the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
\v 2 And Jesus calling a little boy, set him in the midst of them,
\v 3 and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be changed and be as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
\v 4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself, as this little child, he shall be greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 5 And whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth me.
\v 6 And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones, who believe in me, to stumble, it were better for him that a millstone was hung at his neck, and that he was sunk in the depth of the sea.
\p
\v 7 Wo to the world because of offences! for there is a necessity that offences come: nevertheless, wo to that man by whom the offence cometh!
\v 8 If then thy hand, or thy foot, lead thee to offend, cut them off, and cast them from thee: for it were better for thee to enter into life, halting or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the fire, which is eternal.
\v 9 And if thine eye lead thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee, for it were better for thee to enter into life with one eye only, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire.
\p
\v 10 See that ye despise not one of these little ones, for I say unto you, That their angels in heaven continually behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
\v 11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
\p
\v 12 What think you? If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them stray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine in the mountains, and go and seek that which had strayed?
\v 13 And if he happen to find it, verily I say unto you, that he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which never went astray.
\v 14 Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones perish.
\p
\v 15 Now if thy brother sin against thee, go and reprove him between thyself and him alone; if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
\v 16 But if he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be confirmed.
\v 17 But if he disregard them, inform the church: and if he disregard the church, let him be to thee as a heathen, or a publican.
\v 18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever things ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever things ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\v 19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you are concurring upon earth, respecting any matter, which ye shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
\v 20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
\p
\v 21 Then Peter coming to him, said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
\v 22 Jesus saith to him, I tell thee not until seven times, but unto seventy times seven.
\p
\v 23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven like unto a certain king who purposed to settle his account with his servants.
\v 24 And when he began to make up the account, there was brought to him one debtor, ten thousand talents in arrear:
\v 25 but not having wherewithal to pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, and his wife and his children, and all things whatsoever he possessed, and payment to be made.
\v 26 Then that servant falling prostrate, paid him the most profound homage, saying, Lord, have forbearance with me, and I will pay thee all.
\v 27 Then his lord, moved with compassion towards that servant, discharged him, and forgave him the debt.
\v 28 But that servant going out, found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing, throttled him, saying, Pay me what thou owest.
\v 29 Then his fellow-servant fell at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have forbearance with me, and I will pay thee all.
\v 30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay what he owed.
\v 31 Then his fellow-servants, when they saw what was done, were exceedingly sorry, and came to their lord, and gave him an explicit account of all things that had passed.
\v 32 Then his lord, calling him before him, said to him, Thou vile slave! all that debt I forgave thee, because thou besoughtest me:
\v 33 and oughtest thou not to have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?
\v 34 And his lord, incensed, delivered him up to the torturers, till he should pay all that he owed him.
\v 35 Even so also will my heavenly Father do to you, except ye forgive every one of you his brother, from your hearts, their trespasses.
\c 19
\cl CHAP. XIX.
\p
\v 1 AND it came to pass when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan.
\v 2 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
\v 3 And the Pharisees came to him, tempting him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
\v 4 But he replying, said unto them, Have ye not read, that he who created them from the beginning, created them male and female?
\v 5 And he said, for this reason shall a man forsake father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
\v 6 Wherefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath yoked together, let no man separate.
\v 7 They say unto him, Why then did Moses command to give her a bill of divorce, and to put her away?
\v 8 He saith unto them, It was on account of the hardness of your hearts that Moses gave you permission to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not thus.
\v 9 And I tell you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, except for whoredom, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth the divorced woman, committeth adultery.
\v 10 His disciples said unto him, If the case of a man with his wife be thus, it is not expedient to marry.
\v 11 Then he said to them, All men are not capable of receiving this saying, but they to whom it is given.
\v 12 For there are eunuchs, who were so from their mothers’ womb; and there are eunuchs, who have been made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven. He that is capable of receiving, let him receive it.
\p
\v 13 Then were brought to him little children, that he should lay his hands upon them, and pray \add for them\add*: but the disciples rebuked them.
\v 14 Then said Jesus, Permit little children, and hinder them not from coming to me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
\v 15 And when he had laid his hands upon them, he departed thence.
\p
\v 16 And lo! a person coming to him, said, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, in order to attain eternal life?
\v 17 Then he said to him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, even God: but if thou art desirous of entering into life, keep the commandments.
\v 18 He saith unto him, Which? Then said Jesus, these, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
\v 19 Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
\v 20 The young man saith to him, All these things have I observed from my youth: in what am I still deficient?
\v 21 Jesus said to him, If thou art desirous to be perfect, go, sell all thy substance, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
\v 22 Now when the young man heard this speech, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
\p
\v 23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That very difficultly shall a rich man enter into the kingdom of heaven.
\v 24 And again I repeat it to you, It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
\v 25 But when his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
\v 26 And Jesus looking upon them, said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
\p
\v 27 Then Peter addressing him, said unto him, Lo! we have left all and followed thee; what, I pray thee, shall we receive?
\v 28 Then said Jesus unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye who have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\v 29 And every one who hath left family, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name sake, shall receive an hundred fold, and shall inherit life eternal.
\v 30 But many, now first, will be the last; and last, who will be the first.

\cl CHAP. XX.
\p
\v 1 FOR the kingdom of heaven is like a man, the master of a family, who went out at break of day, to hire labourers into his vineyard.
\v 2 And when he had agreed with the labourers at a denarius a day, he sent them into the vineyard.
\v 3 And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing in the market place unemployed.
\v 4 And he said to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever is equitable, I will give it you. So they went.
\v 5 Again going out, about the sixth and ninth hour, he did after the same manner.
\v 6 But about the eleventh hour, going out, he found others standing unemployed, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
\v 7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatever is equitable, ye shall receive.
\v 8 Now when the evening came, the master of the vineyard said to his overseer, Call the labourers, and give them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.
\v 9 And when they came, who began about the eleventh hour, they received each a denarius.
\v 10 But when the first came, they expected that they should receive more; and they also received every man a denarius.
\v 11 But when they received it, they murmured against the master of the family:
\v 12 saying, These last have wrought only a single hour, and thou hast put them on an equality with us, who have borne the burden and heat of the day.
\v 13 But he answering, said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no injustice; did I not agree with thee for a denarius?
\v 14 Take then thine own, and begone: I chuse to give to this last even as to thee.
\v 15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?
\v 16 Thus shall the last be first, and the first last; for many are called, but the elect are few.
\p
\v 17 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took his twelve disciples aside on the road, and said to them;
\v 18 Lo! we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,
\v 19 and shall deliver him to the Gentiles, to insult, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall rise again.
\p
\v 20 Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children, with her sons, paying him obeisance, and petitioning a favour of him.
\v 21 Then he said to her, What is thy wish? She saith unto him, Tell me that these my two sons shall sit, the one at thy right hand, and the other at thy left, in thy kingdom.
\v 22 Then Jesus answering said, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink of the cup that I am going to drink, and be baptised with the baptism with which I am baptised? They say unto him, We are able.
\v 23 And he saith unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of my cup, and with the baptism with which I am baptised, shall ye be baptised; but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, it is not in my power to bestow, but on those, for whom it was prepared by my Father.
\p
\v 24 And the twelve, on hearing this, were filled with indignation against the two brethren.
\v 25 But Jesus, calling them to him, said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority among them.
\v 26 But thus shall it not be with you. But whosoever will be a great man among you, let him be your servant;
\v 27 and whosoever will be first, let him be your slave.
\v 28 Even as the Son of man came not to be waited upon, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.
\p
\v 29 And as they were going out of Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
\v 30 And, behold, two blind men sat by the road side, who hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, son of David!
\v 31 And the multitude checked them, that they should be silent; but they cried out the more, Have mercy on us, Lord, son of David.
\v 32 And Jesus standing called them, and said, What desire ye, that I should do for you?
\v 33 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
\v 34 Then Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes recovered sight, and they followed him.
\c 21
\cl CHAP. XXI.
\p
\v 1 AND when they drew nigh to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage to the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
\v 2 saying to them, Go into the village, which is opposite you, and immediately you will find an ass tied, and a foal with her; loose and bring them to me.
\v 3 And if any man say aught to you, ye shall tell them, That the Lord hath need of them, and immediately he will send them.
\v 4 Now this was entirely done, that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
\v 5 “Tell the daughter of Sion, Lo! thy King cometh to thee, meek, and sitting on an ass, even on a foal the ass’s colt.”
\v 6 Then the disciples going, and doing as Jesus had commanded them,
\v 7 brought the ass and her foal, and they spread over them their garments, and seated him upon them.
\v 8 And a vast multitude spread their garments on the road, and others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them on the road:
\v 9 and the multitudes who went before, and who followed after, cried, saying, Hosanna, to the son of David; blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
\p
\v 10 And when he was entered into Jerusalem, the whole city was in commotion, saying, Who is this?
\v 11 Then the multitudes said, This is Jesus, the prophet, who is from Nazareth of Galilee.
\p
\v 12 And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all those who sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold doves
\v 13 and said unto them, It is written, “My house shall be called a house of prayer,” but ye have made it a den of robbers.
\p
\v 14 Then the blind and the lame came unto him, into the temple, and he cured them.
\v 15 But when the chief priests and scribes saw the marvellous acts which he did, and the children crying out in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were filled with indignation;
\v 16 and said to him, Hearest thou what these say? Jesus replied to them, Yes; but have ye never read, “That out of the mouths of infants and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?”
\v 17 And turning his back upon them, he went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
\p
\v 18 Now in the morning, when returning into the city, he was hungry:
\v 19 and seeing a fig-tree at the road side, he went up to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only: and saith unto it, Let no fruit spring from thee henceforth for ever: and immediately the fig-tree withered entirely away.
\v 20 And when his disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How suddenly is the fig-tree withered away!
\v 21 But Jesus addressing them, said, Verily I tell you, if ye have faith, and entertain no doubt, not only shall ye do what is done to the fig-tree, but if ye should even say to this mountain, Be lifted up, and be cast into the sea, it be done.
\v 22 And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
\p
\v 23 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him, as he was teaching, demanding, By what authority doest thou these things? And who gave thee this authority?
\v 24 Then Jesus answering, said to them, I also will ask you one question, which if ye answer me, then will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
\v 25 The baptism of John whence was it? from heaven, or from men? Hereupon they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we reply, From heaven, he will say to us, Why then did ye not believe him?
\v 26 But if we say, From men, we are afraid of the populace, for they all hold John as a prophet.
\v 27 So they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. Then said he also to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
\p
\v 28 But what think ye? A man had two sons; and coming to the first he said, Son, go work to-day in my vineyard.
\v 29 But he answering said, I will not: yet repenting afterwards, he went.
\v 30 And coming to the other, he spake after the same manner, and he replying, said, I go, sir; yet went not.
\v 31 Which of the two did the will of his father? They say to him, The first. Jesus saith to them, Verily I say unto you, That tax-gatherers and harlots shall go before you into the kingdom of God.
\v 32 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the tax-gatherers and harlots believed on him. But ye, when ye saw it, repented not afterwards, that ye should believe on him.
\p
\v 33 Hear another parable: There was a certain man, the master of a family, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged in it a wine-press, and built a tower, and hired it out to husbandmen, and went into a distant country.
\v 34 But when the season for fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen to receive his fruits.
\v 35 And the husbandmen took his servants, one they beat, and another they killed, and a third they stoned.
\v 36 Again he sent other servants more than the first, and they treated them in the same manner.
\v 37 Then at last he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
\v 38 But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir, come let us kill him, and let us seize on the inheritance.
\v 39 And they took him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.
\v 40 When therefore the master of the vineyard cometh, what will he do with these husbandmen?
\v 41 They say unto him, He will dreadfully destroy those wicked wretches, and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, who will render him the fruits in their seasons.
\v 42 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye not read in the Scriptures, “The stone, which the builders rejected; the same is become the head of the corner; this is done by the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.”
\v 43 Therefore I tell you, That the kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and given to a nation, producing the fruits thereof.
\v 44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be broken in pieces, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.
\v 45 And when the chief priests and Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he was speaking concerning them.
\v 46 And they sought to apprehend him; but were afraid of the people, for they held him as a prophet.
\c 22
\cl CHAP. XXII.
\p
\v 1 AND Jesus continuing his discourse, spake again to them in parables, saying,
\v 2 The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, who made a marriage-feast for his son:
\v 3 and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the entertainment: and they would not come.
\v 4 Again he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who have been invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and the fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come unto the marriage-feast.
\v 5 But they gave themselves no concern about it, and went their several ways, one to his own farm, and another to his traffick:
\v 6 And the rest seizing his servants, insulted and slew them.
\v 7 Then the king, when he heard it, was incensed: and sending out his armies, destroyed these murderers, and burnt down their city.
\v 8 Then he said to his servants, The wedding entertainment indeed is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy:
\v 9 go therefore into the thoroughfares of the roads, and as many as ye find, invite to the banquet.
\v 10 So these servants going out into the roads, collected all, as many as they found, both bad and good; and the wedding feast was fully furnished with guests.
\v 11 Then the king coming in to look around on the guests, saw there a man who had not put on the wedding garment:
\v 12 and he saith to him, Friend, how came thou in here, not having the garment provided for the marriage feast? And he was speechless.
\v 13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind his feet and hands, and take him away, and cast him into the darkness, which is without; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\v 14 For many are called, but few elect.
\p
\v 15 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel together how they might lay a snare to entrap him in his discourse.
\v 16 And they sent to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God with veracity; and carest for no man, for thou regardest not the person of men:
\v 17 tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar, or not?
\v 18 But Jesus knew their wicked design, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?
\v 19 Shew me the money for the tribute; and they brought him a denarius.
\v 20 And he saith unto them, Whose figure is this and inscription?
\v 21 They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he to them, Render therefore to Caesar, the things which are Caesar’s; and to God, the things which are God’s.
\v 22 And when they heard him, they marvelled, and leaving him, went away.
\p
\v 23 On the same day the Sadducees came to him, who say, that there is no resurrection, and they put a question to him,
\v 24 saying, Master, Moses said, “If a man die having no children, his brother in right of affinity shall marry his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.”
\v 25 Now there were with us seven brothers; and the first marrying, died, and had no offspring, and left his wife to his brother;
\v 26 likewise the second also; then the third; so on to the seven.
\v 27 Last of all the woman died also.
\v 28 In the resurrection therefore, whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
\v 29 Jesus then answering, said unto them, Ye are in an error, from not knowing the Scriptures, and the power of God.
\v 30 For at the resurrection, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
\v 31 But with respect to the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read what was spoken to you of God, saying,
\v 32 “I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?” God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
\v 33 And when the multitude heard it, they were amazingly struck with his doctrine.
\p
\v 34 But the Pharisees hearing that he had stopped the Sadducees’ mouths, they assembled together:
\v 35 and one of them, a teacher of the law, put a question to him, to make trial of him, and said,
\v 36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
\v 37 Then Jesus said to him, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.”
\v 38 This is the first and great commandment.
\v 39 And the second is like to it, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”
\v 40 On these two commandments, the whole law and the prophets depend.
\p
\v 41 The Pharisees being then assembled, Jesus put a question to them,
\v 42 saying, What think ye of the Messiah, whose son is he? They say unto him, David’s.
\v 43 He saith unto them, How then doth David by the Spirit call him Lord? saying,
\v 44 “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I put thine enemies as a footstool for thy feet.”
\v 45 If then David calleth him Lord, how is he his son?
\v 46 And no man could answer him a word, neither durst any man, from that day, interrogate him any more.
\c 23
\cl CHAP. XXIII.
\p
\v 1 THEN Jesus spake to the multitudes and to his disciples,
\v 2 saying, The scribes and Pharisees are seated on the chair of Moses;
\v 3 all things therefore which they prescribe for you to observe, observe and practise; but do not according to their works, for they say, yet do not practise.
\v 4 For they bind burdens grievous, and difficultly borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they will not move them with a finger of their own.
\v 5 And all their works they do to be seen of men: they make their phylacteries broad, and deepen the fringes of their garments,
\v 6 and love the principal couch at suppers, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
\v 7 and salutations in the places of public concourse, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
\v 8 But be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your leader, the Messiah; and ye all are brethren.
\v 9 And call no man your father upon earth; for one is your father, who is in heaven.
\v 10 And be not called leaders; for one is your leader, the Messiah.
\v 11 But he who is greatest among you shall be your servant.
\v 12 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and whosoever abaseth himself shall be exalted.
\p
\v 13 Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye shut up the kingdom of heaven from men; for ye yourselves enter not in, and those who were coming in, ye suffer not to enter.
\v 14 Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: wherefore ye shall receive greater condemnation.
\v 15 Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is gained, ye make him doubly more the child of hell than yourselves.
\v 16 Wo unto you ye blind guides! who say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, it is binding.
\v 17 Ye fools and blind! for which is the greater, the gold, or the temple which consecrates the gold?
\v 18 And again, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, it is binding.
\v 19 Ye fools and blind! which is the greater, the gift, or the altar which consecrates the gift?
\v 20 Whosoever therefore sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things that are upon it.
\v 21 And whosoever sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him also who dwelleth in it.
\v 22 So he that sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him who is seated upon it.
\p
\v 23 Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithes of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have neglected the weightier precepts of the law, judgment, and mercy, and fidelity: these thing ought ye to have done, and not to leave the others undone.
\v 24 Ye blind guides! who strain out a gnat, but gulp down a camel.
\v 25 Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup, and of the dish, but within they are full of rapacity and intemperance.
\v 26 Thou blind Pharisee! cleanse first the inside of the cup and dish, that their outside may become clean also.
\v 27 Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye resemble tombs whitewashed, which outwardly indeed appear specious, but within are full of dead men’s bones, and all manner of impurity.
\v 28 And just so, ye without indeed appear to men righteous, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
\v 29 Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the sepulchres of the just,
\v 30 and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
\v 31 Wherefore ye bear a testimony to yourselves, that ye are the children of those who killed the prophets.
\v 32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
\v 33 Ye serpents, ye broods of vipers! how can ye escape from the damnation of hell?
\v 34 Therefore, behold, I am sending to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and some of them ye shall kill, and crucify; and some of them ye shall scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city:
\v 35 that upon you may come all the righteous blood which hath been poured out upon the earth, from the blood of the righteous Abel, to the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
\v 36 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come on this generation.
\p
\v 37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest those who were sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children to me, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not?
\v 38 Behold, your habitation is left unto you desolate.
\v 39 For I tell you, Ye shall henceforth no more see me, until ye say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
\c 24
\cl CHAP. XXIV.
\p
\v 1 AND Jesus departing was going his way from the temple: and his disciples came to him, to point out to his observation the buildings of the temple.
\v 2 But Jesus said unto them, Do you not see all these things? I tell you of a certainty, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, which shall not be utterly thrown down.
\p
\v 3 Then as he was sitting upon the mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall there things be? and what is the sign of thy coming, and of the consummation of the age?
\v 4 And Jesus answering said unto them, Beware that no man deceive you.
\v 5 For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Messiah; and shall deceive multitudes.
\v 6 And ye shall hear of wars, and rumours of wars: see that ye be not terrified: for these things must first be, but the end is not yet.
\v 7 For nation shall be roused up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in diverse places.
\v 8 Now all these things are the beginning of the travailing pangs.
\v 9 Then shall they deliver you up to affliction, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.
\v 10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and hate one another.
\v 11 And many false prophets shall arise, and shall deceive many.
\v 12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many will grow cool.
\v 13 But he that endureth to the end, that man will be saved.
\v 14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached through the whole world for a testimony to all the nations: and then shall come the final close.
\v 15 When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by the prophet Daniel, erected in the holy place, (let him that readeth, mark this,)
\v 16 then let such as are in Judea flee into the mountains.
\v 17 Let not him who is upon the roof go down to take any thing out of his house.
\v 18 And he that is in the field, let him not turn back to take his garment.
\v 19 But wo to those who are with child, and have an infant at their breasts in those days!
\v 20 And pray that your flight be not in winter, nor on the sabbath.
\v 21 For then the tribulation will be great, such as never was from the beginning of the world, and never more shall be.
\v 22 And except those days were shortened, there would be no flesh saved: but for the elect’s sake these days shall be shortened.
\v 23 Then if any man say unto you, Lo! here is the Messiah, or there; believe it not:
\v 24 for false Messiahs and false prophets shall arise, and give out great signs and wonders; so as to deceive, if it were possible, even the elect.
\v 25 Behold, I have forewarned you.
\v 26 Therefore if they say to you, He is in the wilderness; go not out: lo! he is in the secret closets; believe it not.
\v 27 For as the lightning cometh out from the east, and flashes to the west; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
\v 28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
\v 29 Then, immediately after the tribulation of those days, shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
\v 30 And then shall the sign of the Son of man appear in the heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth lament bitterly, and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
\v 31 And he shall send forth his angels with a trumpet, and a great shout, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the extremities of the heavens to the extremities of the same.
\p
\v 32 Learn then a parable from the fig-tree; when its branch is now tender, and the leaves shoot forth, ye know that summer is nigh:
\v 33 just so ye, when ye behold these things, know that it is near, even at the gates.
\v 34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away until all these things shall be done.
\v 35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall in no wise pass away.
\v 36 But of that day and hour no man knoweth, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father alone.
\v 37 But as the days of Noah were, so also shall the coming of the Son of man be.
\v 38 For as they were in the days preceding the deluge, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
\v 39 and they knew it not till the deluge came, and swept them all away; such also shall the coming of the Son of man be.
\v 40 Then two shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other dismissed.
\v 41 Two women grinding at the mill; the one taken, the other dismissed.
\v 42 Watch therefore: for ye know not at what hour your Master cometh.
\v 43 And this observe, that if the master of the family had known in which watch of the night the thief would have come, he would have watched, and not have suffered him to break into his house.
\v 44 Therefore be ye also prepared: for in an hour that ye think not, the Son of man cometh.
\p
\v 45 Who then is the faithful and provident servant, whom his Lord hath appointed over his household, to give them meat in the proper time?
\v 46 Blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find thus occupied.
\v 47 Verily I say unto you, that he will place him over all his substance.
\v 48 But if that wicked servant say in his heart, My master will be a long while ere he comes;
\v 49 and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
\v 50 the master of that servant will come in a day that he doth not expect him, and at an hour which he knoweth not.
\v 51 And will cut him asunder, and give him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\c 25
\cl CHAP. XXV.
\p
\v 1 THEN shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten virgins, who taking their lamps, went forth to meet the bridegroom.
\v 2 But five of them were provident, and five foolish.
\v 3 Those who were taking their lamps, took no oil with them:
\v 4 but the provident took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
\v 5 But as the bridegroom stayed long, they all slumbered and slept.
\v 6 Then at midnight the cry came, Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go forth to meet him.
\v 7 Then all these virgins arose, and set about trimming their lamps.
\v 8 And the foolish said to the provident, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
\v 9 But the provident replied, saying, No; lest there be not a sufficiency for us and you: but go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.
\v 10 But while they were gone away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they who were prepared went in with him to the marriage-feast: and the door was shut.
\v 11 Then came afterwards the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us.
\v 12 But he answering said, Verily, I know you not.
\v 13 Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour in which the Son of man cometh.
\p
\v 14 For the case is like that of a man, who travelling abroad, called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods.
\v 15 And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his several capacity; and immediately went abroad.
\v 16 He then who had received the five talents, went and traded with them, and acquired five other talents.
\v 17 In the same manner also he that had the two, gained also himself two others.
\v 18 But he that had received the one talent, went and digged a hole in the ground, and hid the silver of his master.
\v 19 Then after a long absence the master of these servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.
\v 20 And he who had received the five talents, coming to him, brought five other talents, saying, Sir, thou deliveredst to me five talents: I have gained to them five other talents.
\v 21 His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many: enter into the joy of thy master.
\v 22 Then came also he that had received the two talents: and said, Sir, thou deliveredst to me two talents: lo! I have gained to them two other talents.
\v 23 His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many: enter thou into thy master’s joy.
\v 24 Then came also he that had received the one talent, and said, Sir, knowing thee, that thou art a severe man, reaping where thou hast not sowed, and gathering from whence thou hast not scattered:
\v 25 and being afraid, I went and hid thy talent in the ground: see here, thou hast thine own.
\v 26 Then his master answering said to him, Thou wicked and idle slave, thou knewest that I reap whence I had not sown, and gather where I had not scattered:
\v 27 thou oughtest then to have placed my money with the bankers, so when I came I should have received my own with interest.
\v 28 Take therefore from him the talent, and give it to him that hath the ten talents.
\v 29 For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.
\v 30 And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\p
\v 31 But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:
\v 32 and before him shall all the nations be gathered together; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats:
\v 33 and he shall place the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at the left.
\v 34 Then shall the King say to those on his right-hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;
\v 35 for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and ye received me hospitably:
\v 36 naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye took care of me: I was in prison, and ye came to me.
\v 37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
\v 38 When indeed saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
\v 39 When indeed saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
\v 40 And the king answering shall say to them, Verily I tell you, for as much as ye have done it to one of these my brethren, the very least of them, ye have done it unto me.
\p
\v 41 Then shall he say also to those on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
\v 42 for I was hungry, and ye gave me nothing to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me nothing to drink:
\v 43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye did not clothe me: sick, and in prison, and ye took no care of me.
\v 44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
\v 45 Then shall he reply to them, saying, For as much as ye have not done it to one of the least of these, neither have ye done it to me.
\v 46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

\p
\v 1 AND it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,
\v 2 Ye know that after two days is the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
\v 3 Then were the chief priests and scribes, and the elders of the people gathered together in the palace of the high-priest, called Caiaphas.
\v 4 And they consulted together, how they might seize Jesus by guile, and put him to death.
\v 5 But they said, Not on the feast-day, lest there be a tumult among the people.
\p
\v 6 Now when Jesus was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
\v 7 there came to him a woman having an alabaster-box of very precious aromatic ointment, and poured it upon his head as he sat at table.
\v 8 But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, For what end is this waste?
\v 9 For this ointment might have been sold for a considerable sum, and given to the poor.
\v 10 Then Jesus knowing it, said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath performed a good act upon me:
\v 11 for the poor ye have always with you, but me ye have not always:
\v 12 for in pouring this odoriferous ointment on my body, she hath done it for my burial.
\v 13 Verily I say unto you, Wherever this Gospel is preached through the whole world, what she hath done shall be also spoken of for a memorial of her.
\p
\v 14 Then went one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests,
\v 15 and said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? Then they placed before him thirty pieces of silver.
\v 16 And from that time he sought an opportunity to deliver him up to them.
\p
\v 17 Then on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
\v 18 And he said, Go into the city, unto such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand: I will keep the passover with my disciples at thy house.
\v 19 And his disciples did as Jesus commanded them; and they made ready the passover.
\v 20 And when the evening was come, he sat down at table with the twelve.
\v 21 And as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
\v 22 And exceedingly grieved, they began to say to him every one of them, Lord, am I the person?
\v 23 But he answering said, He that dippeth his hand with me into the dish, that man shall betray me.
\v 24 The Son of man indeed is departing, as it is written of him: but wo to that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed! well had it been for that man if he had never had a being.
\v 25 Then Judas, who betrayed him, addressing him said, Master, is it I? He saith to him, Thou hast named the person.
\p
\v 26 Then as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessing, brake, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
\v 27 And taking the cup, and giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of this:
\v 28 for this is my blood, that \add blood\add* of the new testament, which is shed for many, for the remission of sins.
\v 29 And I tell you, That I will no more henceforth drink of this produce of the vine, until that day when I drink it with you, new, in the kingdom of my Father.
\v 30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.
\p
\v 31 Then saith Jesus unto them, Ye all will be offended at me this night: for it is written, “I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.”
\v 32 But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
\v 33 Then Peter, taking up the word, said to him, Though all should be offended at thee, yet will I never be offended.
\v 34 Jesus saith to him, I tell thee of a certainty, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
\v 35 Peter said to him, Though I should die with thee, never will I deny thee. In like manner also said all the disciples.
\v 36 Then cometh Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.
\v 37 And taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be deeply sorrowful, and to be overwhelmed with dejection.
\v 38 Then saith he to them. My soul is exceeding sorrowful even to death: abide here, and watch with me.
\v 39 And going a little farther, he fell on his face, praying, and saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.
\v 40 And he cometh to the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and he saith to Peter, Is it so, that ye have not strength to watch with me one hour?
\v 41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak.
\v 42 Again the second time he went away, and prayed, saying, O my Father, If it be not possible, that this cup pass from me, but that I should drink it, thy will be done.
\v 43 And coming, he found them asleep again, for their eyes were weighed down.
\v 44 And leaving them, he went away again, and prayed the third time, repeating the same sentence.
\v 45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Do ye still sleep on, and repose yourselves? lo! the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\v 46 Arise, let us go: lo! he that betrayeth me approaches.
\p
\v 47 And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas one of the twelve came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
\v 48 Now he that betrayed him had given them a signal, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: seize him.
\v 49 And immediately approaching to Jesus, he said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
\v 50 Then spake Jesus to him, Friend, for what purpose art thou here? Then approaching they laid hands on Jesus, and seized him.
\p
\v 51 And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretching out his hand, drew his sword, and striking at a servant of the high-priest, cut off his ear.
\v 52 Then saith Jesus unto him, Return thy sword into its sheath: for all who take the sword, shall perish by the sword.
\v 53 Thinkest thou, that I cannot now entreat my Father, and he will give me more than twelve legions of angels?
\v 54 But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
\p
\v 55 In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid not hold upon me.
\v 56 But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets should be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
\p
\v 57 Then they who had apprehended Jesus, brought him to Caiaphas the high-priest, where the scribes and elders were assembled.
\v 58 But Peter followed him at a great distance unto the palace of the high-priest, and entering in, sat down with the servants, to see the issue.
\v 59 Now the chief priests and elders and the whole sanhedrim, sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;
\v 60 and found none: and though many false witnesses came, they found it not \add sufficient\add*. But at the last two false witnesses stepping forth,
\v 61 said, This fellow said, I am able to pull down the temple of God, and to build it up in three days.
\v 62 And the high-priest rising up, said to him, Answerest thou nothing? what do these men witness against thee?
\v 63 But Jesus was silent. And the high-priest addressing him, said, I adjure thee, by the living God, that thou tell us, if thou art the Messiah, the Son of God.
\v 64 Jesus saith to him, Thou hast spoken \add the fact\add*. Moreover I tell you, hereafter ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
\v 65 Then the high-priest rent his garments, saying, he hath blasphemed: what farther need have we of witnesses? lo! now ye have heard his blasphemy:
\v 66 what think ye? They answered and said, He is deserving of death.
\v 67 Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him about; and some slapt his face with their hands,
\v 68 saying, Prophesy to us, you Messiah, who it is that struck thee!
\p
\v 69 Now Peter sat without in the hall: and there came to him a single maid-servant, saying, Thou also wert with Jesus of Galilee.
\v 70 But he denied it before them all, asserting, I know not what thou art saying.
\v 71 Then as he was going out at the gate, another maid-servant saw him, and saith to those who were there, This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth.
\v 72 Then again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.
\v 73 But after a little while they who stood by, came up and said to Peter, Assuredly thou also art one of them: for even thy speech maketh thee manifest.
\v 74 Then began he to utter the bitterest curses, and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
\v 75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said unto him, Before the cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And going out, he wept bitterly.

\p
\v 1 NOW when the morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus how they might put him to death.
\v 2 And having bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
\v 3 Then Judas who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting, carried back the thirty silver pieces to the chief priests and the elders,
\v 4 saying, I have sinned, in betraying innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.
\v 5 And throwing down the silver pieces in the temple, he departed; and going out, hanged himself.
\v 6 Then the chief priests taking up the silver pieces, said, It is not lawful to put them to the treasure destined for sacred uses, because it is the price of blood.
\v 7 So taking counsel, they bought with them a potter’s field, as a burial-place for strangers.
\v 8 Therefore is that field called, The field of blood unto this day.
\v 9 Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty silver pieces, the price of him who had been estimated at that rate, whom they of the children of Israel did value:
\v 10 and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord had ordered me.
\p
\v 11 Then was Jesus placed before the governor, and the governor interrogated him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? Then Jesus replied to him, Thou sayest \add true\add*.
\v 12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he made no reply.
\v 13 Then saith Pilate to him, Hearest thou not how many things they testify against thee?
\v 14 And he made him no reply, no not to a single word: so that the governor marvelled exceedingly.
\v 15 Now at the feast, the governor had been accustomed to release one prisoner to the people, whomsoever they chose.
\v 16 And they had at that time a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.
\v 17 Being therefore gathered around him, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus called Messiah?
\v 18 For he knew that out of envy they had delivered him up.
\p
\v 19 Then, as he was sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent a message to him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous person; for I have suffered much to-day in a dream on his account.
\v 20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the populace that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
\v 21 The governor repeating the question, said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? They said Barabbas.
\v 22 Pilate saith unto them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called the Messiah? They all say to him, Let him be crucified.
\v 23 The governor replied, But what evil hath he done? They cried out with greater vehemence, saying, Let him be crucified.
\v 24 When Pilate saw that it was of no use to contend, but that rather a tumult was rising, he took water, and washed his hands before the people, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man: ye must answer for it.
\v 25 Then all the people answering said, His blood be on us, and on our children.
\p
\v 26 Then he released unto them Barabbas: but having scourged Jesus, he delivered him up to be crucified.
\v 27 Thereupon the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus away to the Praetorium, gathered around him the whole band:
\v 28 and stripping him, put about him a scarlet cloak.
\v 29 And platting a crown of thorns, they placed it on his head, and a cane in his right hand: and bowing the knee before him, mocked him, saying, Hail, king of the Jews!
\v 30 And spitting upon him, they took the cane, and struck him upon his head.
\v 31 And when they had insulted him, they took off from him the cloak, and put his own garments on him, and led him away to crucify him.
\v 32 And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; him they compelled to carry his cross.
\p
\v 33 And when they were come to a place called Golgotha (which is called the place of a skull),
\v 34 they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and having tasted it, he refused to drink.
\v 35 Then having crucified him, they parted his garments, casting the lot: that it might be fulfilled, what was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and for my vesture they threw the lot.
\v 36 And sitting down, they guarded him there.
\v 37 And they placed over his head his accusation in writing, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\v 38 Then were crucified with him two robbers, one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
\p
\v 39 And they who were passing by reviled him, shaking their heads,
\v 40 and saying, Thou that canst pull down the temple, and build it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, descend from the cross.
\v 41 And with similar language also did the chief priests, insulting him, with the scribes and elders, and Pharisees,
\v 42 say, He saved others, himself he is unable to save. If he be the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe him.
\v 43 He trusted in God; let him now deliver him, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
\v 44 And in the same manner also, did the robbers who were crucified with him, revile him.
\p
\v 45 Now from the fifth hour darkness fell upon all the land, unto the ninth hour.
\v 46 But about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with an exceeding loud cry, saying, Eli! Eli! lama, sabacthani? that is, My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me?
\v 47 Then some of those who stood there, hearing him, said, This man is calling out for Elias.
\v 48 And immediately one of them, running, and taking a sponge, and filling it with vinegar, and fastening it to a pole, put it to him to drink.
\v 49 The others said, Let him alone, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.
\p
\v 50 Then Jesus crying again with a loud voice gave up the ghost.
\v 51 And, lo! the vail of the temple was rent in two, from the upper part to the bottom; and the earth was shaken; and the rocks were rent;
\v 52 and the sepulchres were opened; and many bodies of saints, who slept, arose;
\v 53 and coming out of the sepulchres after his resurrection, entered into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
\p
\v 54 Then the centurion, and they who were with him, guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things which were done, were exceedingly terrified, saying, Assuredly this was the Son of God.
\p
\v 55 Now there were many women on the spot, looking on at a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
\v 56 among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.
\p
\v 57 But when the evening was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, whose name was Joseph, who himself also was a disciple of Jesus:
\v 58 he going in to Pilate, begged for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered the body to be given him.
\v 59 And Joseph receiving the body, wrapped it in clean linen;
\v 60 and laid it in his own new sepulchre, which he had hewn out in a rock: and rolling a vast stone against the door of the sepulchre, departed.
\v 61 And Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary, were there sitting opposite the sepulchre.
\p
\v 62 Now on the morrow, which is the day after the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came in a body to Pilate,
\v 63 saying, Sir, we have reflected, that this deceiver, when yet alive, said, After three days I will rise again.
\v 64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made perfectly secure until the third day, lest his disciples coming by night, steal him, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead, so the last delusion would be worse than the first.
\v 65 Then said Pilate unto them, Ye have a guard, go and make it as secure as ye think fit.
\v 66 So they went and made the sepulchre secure, putting a seal upon the stone, after placing the guard.
\c 28
\cl CHAP. XXVIII.
\p
\v 1 NOW after the eve of the sabbath, as the light was dawning, towards the first day of the week, Mary Magdalen had come, and the other Mary, to view the sepulchre.
\v 2 And, lo! there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descending from heaven, came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
\v 3 His aspect was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow.
\v 4 And for fear of him the guards shook, and became as dead men.
\v 5 Then the angel addressing them, said to the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye are seeking Jesus who was crucified.
\v 6 He is not here: he is risen, as he said. Come hither, behold the place where the Lord lay.
\v 7 And go quickly, tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead: and, lo! he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.
\v 8 And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear, and great joy; and ran to carry the tidings to his disciples.
\v 9 And as they were going to tell the disciples, then behold Jesus met them saying, Hail! And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
\v 10 Then saith Jesus to them, Be not affrighted: go, tell my disciples that they go into Galilee, there shall they see me.
\p
\v 11 And as they were going, some of the guards who were come into the city, had told the chief priests all things which had happened.
\v 12 And being assembled with the elders, and having held a council, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
\v 13 saying, Report, that his disciples coming by night stole him away, while you were asleep.
\v 14 And if this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and preserve you harmless.
\v 15 So they took the money, and did as they were instructed. And this account is circulated among the Jews to this day.
\p
\v 16 Then the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain, where Jesus had ordered them.
\v 17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him. Still some doubted.
\v 18 Then Jesus approaching, spake to them, saying, All power is given me in heaven and upon earth.
\v 19 Go therefore, make disciples among all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
\v 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo! I am with you at all times even to the end of the world. Amen.
