\mt THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOHN.
\c 1
\cl CHAP. I.
\p
\v 1 IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
\v 2 He was in the beginning with God.
\v 3 All things were made by him; and without him was not one thing made that was made.
\v 4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
\v 5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness did not comprehend it.
\p
\v 6 A man was sent from God, whose name was John.
\v 7 He came for a witness, that he might bear testimony concerning the Light, that all men through him might believe.
\v 8 He was not the Light, but sent that he should bear testimony concerning the Light.
\v 9 He was that true Light, which illumines every man by his coming into the world.
\v 10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
\v 11 He came unto his peculiar people, and his peculiar people did not receive him.
\v 12 But as many as did receive him, on them he bestowed authority to become children of God, even on those who believe on his name:
\v 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
\v 14 And the Word became incarnate, and tabernacled with us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
\p
\v 15 John bore witness concerning him, and cried, saying, This is he of whom I said, He that is coming after me, is before me: because before me he was.
\v 16 And from his plenitude we all have received, even grace corresponding with \add his\add* grace.
\v 17 For the law was given by Moses, but the grace and the reality came by Jesus Christ.
\v 18 No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath thoroughly described him.
\p
\v 19 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites, that they should question him, Who art thou?
\v 20 And he confessed, and denied it not; but acknowledged, I am not the Messiah.
\v 21 And they asked him, What then? art thou Elias? and he said, I am not. Art thou that prophet? and he answered, No.
\v 22 Then said they to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us: What description givest thou of thyself?
\v 23 He said, I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way for the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.
\v 24 And they who were sent, were of the Pharisees.
\v 25 And they questioned him, and said to him, Why then dost thou baptise, if thou be not the Messiah, nor Elias, nor that prophet?
\v 26 John answered them, saying, I baptise with water: but in the midst of you hath stood a person, whom ye have not known;
\v 27 it is he, though coming after me, who was before me, the thong of whole sandal I am not worthy to untie.
\v 28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptising.
\p
\v 29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming to him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world,
\v 30 This is he of whom I spake, After me cometh a man who was before me: for before me he existed.
\v 31 And I knew him not: though that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore am I come baptising with water.
\v 32 And John bore witness, saying, I saw the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it rested upon him.
\v 33 And I did not know him: but he that sent me baptising with water, he said to me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending as a dove, and resting upon him, that is he who baptiseth with the Holy Ghost.
\v 34 And I have seen it, and have borne testimony that this is the Son of God.
\p
\v 35 On the morrow John was again standing with two of his disciples;
\v 36 and looking upon Jesus as he walked by, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!
\v 37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
\v 38 Then Jesus turned about, and seeing them following, saith to them, What are ye seeking? They said unto him, Rabbi (which signifies, when translated, Master), where is thy abode?
\v 39 He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he abode, and continued with him that day: and it was about the tenth hour.
\p
\v 40 One of the two, who had heard from John mention of Jesus, and had followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
\v 41 He first finds his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being translated, the Christ).
\v 42 And he brought him to Jesus. Then Jesus looking on him, said, Thou art Simon the son of Jonas: thou shalt be called Cephas, which, interpreted \add in Greek\add*, is Petros, a Rock.
\p
\v 43 The next day Jesus resolved to go into Galilee, and he findeth Philip, and saith to him, Follow me.
\v 44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
\v 45 Philip findeth Nathaniel, and saith to him, We have found him whom Moses in the law has described, and the prophets, Jesus the son of Joseph, who is of Nazareth.
\v 46 And Nathaniel said to him, Can any thing good come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see.
\v 47 Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite in reality, in whom there is no guile!
\v 48 Nathaniel saith unto him, From whence canst thou know me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.
\v 49 Nathaniel answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the king of Israel.
\v 50 Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, dost thou believe? thou shalt see greater things than these.
\v 51 And he saith to him, Verily, verily, I tell you, From henceforth ye shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

\p
\v 1 AND on the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
\v 2 So Jesus also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage.
\v 3 And the wine being exhausted, the mother of Jesus saith to him, They have no more wine.
\v 4 Jesus saith unto her, What is that to me and thee, woman? my hour is not yet come.
\v 5 His mother saith to the waiters, Whatsoever he orders you, do it.
\v 6 Now there stood there six large stone jars, for the customary purifying ablution of the Jews, containing two or three baths each.
\v 7 Jesus saith to them, Fill these jars with water. And they filled them to the brim.
\v 8 And he said unto them, Draw out now, and carry to the president of the table. So they carried it.
\v 9 And when the president of the table had tasted the water become wine, and knew not whence it came: (but the waiters knew, who drew the water;) the president of the table called the bridegroom,
\v 10 and saith to him, Every man at first produces the good wine; and after men have drunk plentifully, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept back the good wine until now.
\v 11 This beginning of miracles Jesus wrought in Cana of Galilee, and displayed his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
\p
\v 12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and he continued there not many days.
\v 13 And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 14 And he found in the temple those who sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the moneychangers seated:
\v 15 and having made a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and scattered the money of the exchangers, and overturned the tables;
\v 16 and said to those who sold doves, Take these hence; make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.
\v 17 Then the disciples remembered that it was written, “The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.”
\v 18 The Jews then addressed him, and said to him, What miracle shewest thou, seeing thou actest thus?
\v 19 Jesus answered and said to them, Pull down this temple, and in three days I will rear it up again.
\v 20 Then said the Jews, This temple has been forty-six years in building, and canst thou rear it up in three days?
\v 21 Now he had spoken with reference to the temple of his own body.
\v 22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had spoken thus unto them; and they believed the scriptures, and the word which Jesus had spoken.
\p
\v 23 Now while he was at Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, when they beheld the miracles which he did.
\v 24 But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew them all,
\v 25 and because he had no need that any man should testify respecting man; for he knew what was in man.
\c 3
\cl CHAP. III.
\p
\v 1 NOW there was a man of the Pharisees, whose name was Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
\v 2 this man came to Jesus in the night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles which thou dost, unless God be with him.
\v 3 Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
\v 4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?
\v 5 Jesus replied, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
\v 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
\v 7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
\v 8 The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the sound of it, but knowest not from whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth: just so is every one who is born of the Spirit.
\v 9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things?
\v 11 Verily, verity, I tell thee, That what we know we speak, and what we have seen we affirm; and ye receive not our testimony.
\v 12 If I have told you of earthly things, and ye believe not, how will you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?
\v 13 Though no man hath ascended into heaven, except he that descended from heaven, that Son of man the I am in heaven.
\v 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, in like manner must the Son of man be lifted up:
\v 15 that every one who believeth on him may not perish, but have life eternal.
\v 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that every one who believeth in him should not perish, but have life eternal.
\v 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world by him might be saved.
\v 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is already under condemnation, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.
\v 19 Now this is the condemnation, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil.
\v 20 For every one whose practices are foul hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, that his actions may not be brought to conviction.
\v 21 But he who practices the truth, cometh to the light, that his actions may be evident, as being done for God.
\p
\v 22 After these things Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea; and there he abode with them, and baptised.
\v 23 Now John also was baptising at Enon, near to Salem, for there were many streams of water there: and they came, and were baptised.
\v 24 For as yet John was not cast into prison.
\p
\v 25 Then a dispute arose between the disciples of John and the Jews with regard to purification.
\v 26 And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony, lo! this man baptiseth, and all men come to him.
\v 27 John answered and said, A man cannot assume any thing, except it be given him from heaven.
\v 28 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Messiah, but that I am sent before him.
\v 29 It is the bridegroom, who possesses the bride: and the friend of the bridegroom, standing by and hearing him, rejoiceth exceedingly at the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
\v 30 He must grow great, but I diminutive.
\v 31 He that cometh from above is above all: he whose origin is from earth is of the earth, and speaketh of the earth: he who cometh from heaven is above all.
\v 32 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; though no man receiveth his testimony.
\v 33 He that receiveth his testimony hath avouched that God is true.
\v 34 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God hath not given the Spirit by measure unto him.
\v 35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
\v 36 He that believeth on the Son hath life eternal: and he that believeth not on the Son shall not see life: but the wrath of God abideth upon him.

\cl CHAP. IV.
\p
\v 1 AS soon then as the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptised more disciples than John
\v 2 (though Jesus himself did not baptise, but his disciples),
\v 3 he left Judea, and went again into Galilee.
\v 4 Now he must necessarily pass through Samaria.
\v 5 Then he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sichar, near the spot of ground which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
\v 6 And Jacob’s well was there. Therefore Jesus, weary with his journey, e’en sat himself down on the well: it was about the sixth hour.
\v 7 A woman of Samaria comes to draw water: Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink.
\v 8 (For his disciples were gone into the city to buy provisions.)
\v 9 The Samaritan woman therefore saith to him, How canst thou, a Jew, ask of me, who am a Samaritan woman, to drink? for Jews avoid all intercourse with Samaritans.
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to her, If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who he is that speaketh to thee, thou wouldest have requested him, and he would have given thee life-giving water.
\v 11 The woman saith unto him, Thou hast no bucket, and the well is deep: whence then canst thou have this water that giveth life?
\v 12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children, and his cattle?
\v 13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one who drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
\v 14 but whosoever shall drink of the water which I shall give him, he shall no more thirst to eternity; but the water which I will give him, shall be in him a fountain of water springing up to life eternal.
\v 15 The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may no more thirst, nor come hither to draw.
\v 16 Jesus saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
\v 17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus saith to her, Thou hast spoken right, that thou hast no husband:
\v 18 for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in this thou hast spoken true.
\v 19 The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
\v 20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye affirm, That the place where we ought to worship is at Jerusalem.
\v 21 Jesus saith to her, Woman, believe me, that the hour approaches, when ye shall worship the Father neither in this mountain, nor at Jerusalem.
\v 22 Ye worship ye know not what: we worship what we do know: for salvation cometh from the Jews.
\v 23 But the hour is coming, yea, is now come, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such worshippers of him.
\v 24 God is a Spirit: and they who worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.
\v 25 The woman saith, I know that Messiah is coming (who is called Christ): when he cometh, he will inform us of all things.
\v 26 Jesus saith unto her, I that am speaking to thee am he.
\p
\v 27 And upon this came his disciples, and wondered that he talked with the woman: yet no one said, What art thou seeking? or, Why art thou talking with her?
\p
\v 28 Then the woman left her pitcher, and went into the city, and said to the men,
\v 29 Come with me; behold a man, who told me all things that I ever did: is not this the Messiah?
\v 30 Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
\p
\v 31 In the mean time his disciples invited him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
\v 32 But he said to them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
\v 33 Then said his disciples to each other, Hath any person brought him ought to eat?
\v 34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
\v 35 Do ye not say, That yet there are four months, and then the harvest cometh? behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look upon the fields; for they are now white for harvest.
\v 36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
\v 37 For herein is the saying true, That one soweth and another reapeth.
\v 38 I have sent you to reap that on which ye have bestowed no labour: others have laboured, and ye have entered into their labour.
\p
\v 39 Now many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him, on the report of the woman, who said, That he told me all things I ever had done.
\v 40 So on this the Samaritans came to him, and besought him to abide with them: and he tarried there two days.
\v 41 And many more believed because of his own word;
\v 42 and said to the woman, Now we believe, not merely on account of thy relation: for we ourselves have heard, and know that this is of a certainty the Saviour of the world, the Messiah.
\p
\v 43 Then after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
\v 44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
\v 45 When therefore he was come into Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all the things which he did at the feast: for they also had gone to the feast.
\v 46 Then came Jesus again to Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain attendant on the king, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
\v 47 This person having heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, went to him, that he might come down, and cure his son: for he was at the point of death.
\v 48 Then said Jesus unto him, Unless ye see miracles and wonders, ye will not believe.
\v 49 The courtier said to him, Sir, come down before my child is dead.
\v 50 Jesus saith to him, Go home; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word which Jesus had spoken, and went home.
\v 51 And as he was now going down home, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son is recovered!
\v 52 Then inquired he of them the hour at which he began to amend? and they told him, It was yesterday, at the seventh hour, when the fever left him.
\v 53 Then the father knew that it was the very hour when Jesus said, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole family.
\v 54 This is again a second miracle which Jesus did, when he came from Judea into Galilee.
\c 5
\cl CHAP. V.
\p
\v 1 AFTER these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 2 Now there is at Jerusalem near the sheep-market a pool, called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porticos.
\v 3 In these lay a vast multitude of infirm persons, blind, lame, withered, waiting the motion of the water.
\v 4 For occasionally an angel descended into the pool, and put the water into commotion: he therefore who first stepped in after the commotion of the water became well, under whatever complaint he had laboured.
\v 5 And there was a certain man there, who had a complaint of thirty years standing.
\v 6 Jesus seeing him laid there, and knowing that he had been so for a long while, saith to him, Wilt thou be made sound?
\v 7 The infirm man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is disturbed, to cast me into the pool: but when I am coming, another goeth down before me.
\v 8 Jesus saith to him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.
\v 9 And instantly the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked away: and that day was the sabbath.
\v 10 The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
\v 11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same person said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
\v 12 Then they asked him, Who is the man that said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
\v 13 Now he that was cured knew not who he was: for Jesus had slipped away, a crowd being on the spot.
\p
\v 14 After these things Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Take care; thou art made whole: sin no more, lest something worse befall thee.
\v 15 The man went, and informed the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole.
\v 16 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he had done these things on the sabbath-day.
\p
\v 17 Then Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
\v 18 Therefore sought they the more to kill him, because he had not only broken the sabbath, but called God his own Father, setting himself on an equality with God.
\v 19 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing by himself, except what he hath seen the Father do: for whatsoever things he doeth, the same and in the same manner doth the Son.
\v 20 For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things which he himself doeth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that ye may wonder.
\v 21 For as the Father raiseth the dead, and quickeneth them; so also doth the Son quicken whom he pleases.
\v 22 For the Father never judgeth any man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son:
\v 23 in order that all may honour the Son, just as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, doth not honour the Father who sent him.
\v 24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment; but is passed from death into life.
\v 25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, yea, it is now, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
\v 26 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son also to have life in himself;
\v 27 and hath given him authority also to execute judgment, because he is the Son of man.
\v 28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all who are in the graves shall hear his voice,
\v 29 and they shall come forth; they who have done good actions to the resurrection of life; and they who have been guilty of foul practices, to the resurrection of damnation.
\v 30 I am not able to perform any thing by myself: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; for I seek not my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.
\v 31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
\v 32 There is another who beareth witness of me, and I know that his witness is true which he witnesseth concerning me.
\v 33 Ye sent to John, and he bore testimony to the truth.
\v 34 But I receive not testimony from man: but I speak these things, that ye may believe.
\v 35 He was a lamp glowing and luminous: and ye were pleased for a time to exult in his light.
\v 36 But I have a testimony greater than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me that I should fulfil them, these very works which I am doing, they bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
\v 37 And the Father who sent me, himself hath borne witness concerning me. Ye have neither at any time heard his voice, nor seen his form.
\v 38 And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.
\v 39 Search the scriptures; for ye suppose in them ye have eternal life: and these are they which testify of me.
\v 40 And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
\v 41 I receive not glory from men.
\v 42 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
\v 43 I have come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another come in his own name, him ye will receive.
\v 44 How can ye believe, who receiving honour one from another, seek not the honour which cometh from God alone?
\v 45 Do not suppose that I shall accuse you to my Father: there is one who is accusing you, even Moses, on whom ye place your hope.
\v 46 For if ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for of me did he write.
\v 47 But if ye believe not his writings, how will ye believe my words?

\p
\v 1 AFTER these things Jesus went beyond the sea of Galilee, that is of Tiberias.
\v 2 And a vast multitude followed him, because they saw the miracles which he performed on those who were diseased.
\v 3 Then Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat down with his disciple.
\v 4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
\v 5 Then Jesus lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a vast concourse of people was come to him, said to Philip, Whence shall we buy loaves, that these may eat?
\v 6 And this he said to try him: for himself knew what he would do.
\v 7 Philip answered him, Two hundred denarii spent in bread would not procure a sufficiency for them, that every one of them might have a morsel.
\v 8 One of his disciples saith to him, (Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother,)
\v 9 There is a little lad here, who hath five barley-loaves, and two small fishes: but these, what are they among so many?
\v 10 Then said Jesus, Make the men sit down. For there was plenty of grass on the spot. Therefore the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
\v 11 And Jesus took the loaves; and giving thanks, gave to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sat down; and in the same manner of the fishes, as much as they chose.
\v 12 And when they had made a hearty meal, he saith to his disciples, Gather up the broken bits which are left, that not a morsel be wasted.
\v 13 Then they collected them, and filled twelve baskets with fragments out of the five barley-loaves, which were more than enough for those who had eaten.
\v 14 When therefore the men saw the miracle which Jesus had done, they said, This is of a certainty that prophet which is to come into the world.
\v 15 Then Jesus, knowing their intention to come and to seize him by force, in order to make him king, retired again into the mountain by himself alone.
\p
\v 16 So when evening was now come, his disciples went down to the sea-side,
\v 17 and embarking on a vessel were coming across the sea to Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.
\v 18 And the sea was greatly agitated by a tempestuous wind that blew.
\v 19 Having rowed therefore about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and coming near the vessel, and they were affrighted.
\v 20 But he saith to them, It is I; be not afraid.
\v 21 Then they desired to take him into the vessel: and instantly the vessel was at the land whither they were going.
\p
\v 22 The next day the multitude who stayed on the other side of the sea, when they saw that there was no little vessel there, except the one into which his disciples went, and that Jesus went not with his disciples in the vessel, but that his disciples went away alone;
\v 23 (but now little vessels had come from Tiberias near to the spot where they had eaten bread, after the Lord had given thanks:)
\v 24 then when the multitude saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also went into the vessels, and came to Capernaum, in search of Jesus.
\v 25 And when they found him on the other side the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
\v 26 Jesus replied to them and said, Ye seek me, not because ye have seen the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
\v 27 Labour not for the meat which is perishable, but for that meat which endureth unto life eternal, which the Son of man will give you: for him hath the Father sealed, even God.
\v 28 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?
\v 29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye should believe on him whom he hath sent.
\v 30 Then said they to him, What miracle therefore dost thou, that we may see and believe thee? what dost thou work?
\v 31 Our fathers did eat manna in the wilderness; as it is written, “He gave them bread from heaven to eat.”
\v 32 Then said Jesus unto them, Verily, verily, I tell you, It was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the real bread from heaven.
\v 33 For he that cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the world, is the bread of God.
\v 34 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
\v 35 Then said Jesus to them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst more.
\v 36 But I have told you, That though ye have seen me, yet ye have not believed.
\v 37 Every individual which the Father giveth me will come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in nowise cast out.
\v 38 For I came down from heaven, not with a view to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
\v 39 Now this is the will of the Father who sent me, That every thing which he hath given me I should not be deprived of it, but raise it up at the last day.
\v 40 And this is the will of him that sent me, That every one who seeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have life eternal: and I will raise him up at the last day.
\p
\v 41 Then the Jews murmured against him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.
\v 42 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how then saith this man, That I came down from heaven?
\v 43 Jesus answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves.
\v 44 No man can come to me, except the Father who hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
\v 45 It is written in the prophets, And “they shall all be taught of God.” Every one therefore who heareth from the Father, and learneth, cometh to me.
\v 46 Not that any man hath seen the Father, except he that is with God, he hath seen the Father.
\v 47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.
\v 48 I am the bread of life.
\v 49 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and they are dead.
\v 50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that any person may eat of it, and never die.
\v 51 I am the bread that giveth life, which came down from heaven: if any person eat of this bread, he shall live to eternity; and the bread indeed which I shall give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
\p
\v 52 Then the Jews contended with each other, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
\v 53 Jesus therefore said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.
\v 54 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath life eternal: and I will raise him up at the last day.
\v 55 For my flesh truly is meat, and my blood truly is drink.
\v 56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in him.
\v 57 As the life-giving Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me, the same shall live by me.
\v 58 This is the bread which came down from heaven, not as the manna your fathers did eat, and died: he that eateth this bread shall live to eternity.
\p
\v 59 These things he spake in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
\v 60 Many therefore of his disciples, who heard him, said, Difficult is this discourse, who is able to fathom it?
\v 61 Then Jesus, conscious in himself that his disciples murmured concerning this discourse, said unto them, Doth this stumble you?
\v 62 What then if ye see the Son of man ascending where he was formerly?
\v 63 The Spirit is the life-giving power; the flesh contributeth nothing: the declarations which I make to you, they are spirit, and they are life.
\v 64 But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who the person was that should betray him.
\v 65 And he said, Therefore have I informed you, That no man can come to me, except it be given him of my Father.
\p
\v 66 From that \add discourse\add* many of his disciples went away back, and no more followed him about.
\v 67 Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will ye also go away?
\v 68 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, unto whom shall we go from thee? thou hast the words of eternal life.
\v 69 And we have believed and known that thou art the Messiah, the Son of the living God.
\v 70 Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
\v 71 Now he spake of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon: for this man was ready to betray him, though he was one of the twelve.

\cl CHAP. VII.
\p
\v 1 AND Jesus after these things travelled about in Galilee: for he would not go about in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
\v 2 And a feast of the Jews was nigh, the feast of tabernacles.
\v 3 Then said his disciples to him, Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou doest.
\v 4 For no man doeth any thing in secret, yet seeketh himself to appear publicly: if thou doest these things, exhibit thyself to the world.
\v 5 For even his own brethren did not believe on him.
\v 6 Jesus therefore saith to them, My proper time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.
\v 7 The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its deeds are evil.
\v 8 Go ye up to this feast: for I am not yet going up to this feast, because my fixed time is not yet arrived.
\v 9 Thus speaking to them then, he continued in Galilee.
\v 10 But as soon as his disciples were gone up, then went he also himself up to the feast: not in public, but as in concealment.
\p
\v 11 The Jews then sought for him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
\v 12 And there was a great murmur concerning him among the multitude: some said, Surely he is a good man: others said, No; he only deceiveth the people.
\v 13 Yet no person spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
\p
\v 14 But now at the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
\v 15 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man the scriptures, not being a scholar?
\v 16 Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
\v 17 If any man will do his will, he shall know respecting the doctrine, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from myself.
\v 18 He that speaketh from himself, seeks his own individual honour: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and iniquity in him there is none.
\v 19 Hath not Moses given you the law, yet none of you practises the law? Why do ye seek to kill me?
\v 20 The multitude answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who is seeking to kill thee?
\v 21 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have performed one work, and ye all marvel.
\v 22 Because Moses ordered you circumcision; (not that it comes from Moses, but from our ancestors;) so ye circumcise a man on the sabbath-day.
\v 23 If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath-day, that the law of Moses should not be violated; are ye incensed against me, because I have made a man whole on the sabbath-day?
\v 24 Judge not by appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
\v 25 Then said some of the people of Jerusalem, is not this the man whom they are seeking to kill?
\v 26 And, lo! he speaketh openly, and they say not a word to him. Do the rulers certainly know that this man is really the Messiah?
\v 27 But we know this man whence he is: but when the Messiah cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
\v 28 Then spake Jesus aloud as he was teaching in the temple, and said, Ye both know me, and ye know from whence I am: and I came not of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
\v 29 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
\p
\v 30 Then they sought to apprehend him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
\v 31 But many of the multitude believed on him, and said, When the Messiah cometh, will he do greater miracles than those which this man doth?
\v 32 The Pharisees heard the people muttering these things respecting him; and the Pharisees and chief priests sent officers to apprehend him.
\v 33 Then said Jesus unto them, A little while longer I am with you, and I am going to him that sent me.
\v 34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.
\v 35 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will this man go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Grecians, and teach the Greeks?
\v 36 What is this saying which he hath spoken, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come?
\p
\v 37 Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood up and spake aloud, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
\v 38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from his belly shall rivers flow of living water.
\v 39 (Now he spake this in reference to the Spirit, which they who believe on him should afterwards receive: for as yet the Holy Ghost was not given; because Jesus was not yet glorified.)
\v 40 Many then of the multitude, when they heard this declaration, said, This man is certainly a prophet.
\v 41 Others said, He is the Messiah. But others said, No: for cometh the Messiah out of Galilee?
\v 42 Doth not the scripture say, That the Messiah cometh of the seed of David, and from the town of Bethlehem, whence David originally was?
\v 43 There was a division therefore among the multitude on account of him.
\v 44 Now some of them were desirous to apprehend him; but no one laid hands upon him.
\v 45 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisee; and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him?
\v 46 The officers answered, Never did man before speak in such a manner as this man.
\v 47 The Pharisees then replied to them, Are ye also deluded?
\v 48 Hath any one of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
\v 49 But this rabble, which knoweth not the law, is accursed.
\v 50 Nicodemus saith unto them, (the same person who came to him by night, being one of their body,)
\v 51 Doth our law condemn a man, without first hearing his defence, and knowing what he hath done?
\v 52 They answered and said to him, Art thou not from Galilee too? Search and see: for a prophet, out of Galilee, never was raised up.
\v 53 So each went to his own home.

\p
\v 1 THEN Jesus went to the mount of Olives.
\v 2 But early in the morning he came again to the temple, and all the people came to him; and sitting down he taught them.
\v 3 Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman caught in adultery; and placing her in the midst,
\v 4 they say unto him, Master, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act.
\v 5 Now Moses in the law commanded, that such women should be stoned: therefore what sayest thou?
\v 6 But this they said, trying to entrap him, that they might have ground of accusation against him. But Jesus stooping down, with his finger wrote on the ground.
\v 7 Now when they continued questioning him, raising himself up, he said to them, Let the person who is sinless among you, first cast a stone at her.
\v 8 And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.
\v 9 But when they heard him, and felt the conviction of their conscience, they slunk away one by one, beginning from the elders to the last: so Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing in the midst.
\v 10 Then Jesus raising himself up, and seeing no person but the woman, said unto her, Woman, where are these thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
\v 11 She said, No man, Lord. Then said Jesus unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
\p
\v 12 Then spake Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
\v 13 The Pharisees said to him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.
\v 14 Jesus answered and said to them, Though I do bear witness of myself, my witness is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I am going; but ye know not whence I come, nor whither I am going.
\v 15 Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
\v 16 But though I should judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.
\v 17 Now even in your law it is written, that the testimony of two men is true.
\v 18 I am a witness for myself, and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me.
\v 19 Then said they to him, Where is thy father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.
\v 20 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no person apprehended him; for his hour was not yet come.
\p
\v 21 Then spake Jesus again to them, I am going away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I am going ye cannot come.
\v 22 The Jews said therefore, Will he kill himself? because he said, Whither I go, ye cannot come.
\v 23 And he said to them, Ye are from those beneath; I am from those above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
\v 24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am, ye shall die in your sins.
\v 25 They said, therefore to him, Who art thou? And Jesus said to them, Assuredly the same as I am telling you.
\v 26 I have many things to speak and to decide concerning you: but he that sent me is true; and the things which I have heard from him I speak to the world.
\v 27 They knew not that he spake to them of the Father.
\p
\v 28 Then said Jesus to them, When ye shall have lifted up on high the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am, and of myself have I done nothing; but as the Father hath instructed me, so I speak.
\v 29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; because I always do the things acceptable to him.
\v 30 As he spake these words, many believed on him.
\p
\v 31 Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed on him, If ye abide in my word, assuredly ye are my disciples;
\v 32 and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
\v 33 They answered him, We are Abraham’s seed, and never were in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, That we shall be made free?
\v 34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, That every one who committeth sin is the slave of sin.
\v 35 But the slave abideth not in the family for ever: but the son abideth for ever.
\v 36 If the Son therefore make you free, ye will be truly free.
\v 37 I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; yet ye seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.
\v 38 I speak what I have seen with my Father: and ye do therefore what ye have seen with your father.
\v 39 They answered and said unto him, Our Father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would have done the works of Abraham.
\v 40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man who hath told you the truth, which I have heard from God. Abraham did not so.
\v 41 Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We are not born of whoredom; we have one Father, even God.
\v 42 Then said Jesus unto them, If God was your Father, ye would have loved me: for I came out from God, and I am coming; neither indeed came I of myself, but he hath sent me.
\v 43 Wherefore do ye not understand my speech? because ye cannot hear my word.
\v 44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will practise. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not fast in the truth, because truth was not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh what is peculiarly his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
\v 45 But because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.
\v 46 Which of you can convict me of sin? Now if I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me?
\v 47 He that is of God heareth the words of God: ye therefore do not hear him, because ye are not of God.
\p
\v 48 Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Do we not rightly affirm, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
\v 49 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.
\v 50 But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
\v 51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If any man observe my saying, he shall never see death to all eternity.
\v 52 Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If any man observe my word, he shall never taste of death to eternity.
\v 53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?
\p
\v 54 Jesus answered, If I assume glory to myself, my glory is nothing: it is the Father who glorifies me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:
\v 55 yet have ye not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, that I know him not, I should be like you, a liar: but I know him, and observe his word.
\v 56 Your father Abraham exulted for joy that he should see this day of mine: and saw it, and rejoiced.
\v 57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou hast not yet reached the age of fifty, and hast thou seen Abraham?
\v 58 Jesus said unto them, Before Abraham had a being, I Am.
\v 59 Then took they up stones to hurl at him: but Jesus was hid, and went out of the temple, passing through the midst of them, and so went away.

\v 1 AND as he passed along, he saw a man blind from his birth.
\v 2 And his disciples inquired of him, saying, Rabbi, who was in fault, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?
\v 3 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man been in fault, nor his parents; but it is in order to make manifest the works of God in him.
\v 4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night is coming, when no man can work.
\v 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
\v 6 So speaking, he spat on the ground, and made mud with the spittle, and anointed with the mud the eyes of the blind man;
\v 7 and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which signifies, Sent.) Then he went and washed, and came seeing.
\p
\v 8 The neighbours therefore, and they who saw him formerly, that he was blind, said, Is not this the man who was sitting and begging?
\v 9 Some said, That this is he: but others, That he is like him: he himself said, I am he.
\v 10 When said they to him, How were thine eyes opened?
\v 11 he answered and said, A man called Jesus made mud, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: then I went, and washing received sight.
\v 12 They said to him, Where is he? He replied, I know not.
\p
\v 13 They brought him to the Pharisees, who had before been blind.
\v 14 (Now it was the sabbath-day when Jesus made the mud, and opened his eyes.)
\v 15 The Pharisees therefore questioned him again, How he had received sight? And he told them, He put mud upon my eyes, and I washed, and do see.
\v 16 Then said certain of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, because he observeth not the sabbath. Others said, How is it possible for a wicked man to do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
\v 17 They say to the blind man again, What sayest thou of him? that he opened thine eyes? Then he replied, That he is a prophet.
\p
\v 18 Then the Jews did not believe that he had been blind, and received sight, until that they had called the parents of him who had received sight.
\v 19 And they questioned them, saying, Is this your son, of whom ye say, that he was born blind? how then doth he now see?
\v 20 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
\v 21 but how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he himself will tell you about it.
\v 22 So spake his parents, because they were afraid of the Jews: for the Jews had already come to a resolution, that if any person acknowledged him Messiah, he should be excluded the synagogue.
\v 23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
\p
\v 24 The second time therefore they called the man who had been blind, and said unto him, Give the glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.
\v 25 Then answered he and said, Whether this man be a sinner, I know not: one thing I do know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
\v 26 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eves?
\v 27 He answered them, I have already told you, and ye did not hearken: why do ye wish to hear it again? will ye also become his disciples?
\v 28 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are the disciples of Moses.
\v 29 We know that God spake to Moses: but we know nothing of this man, whence he is.
\v 30 The man replied, and said to them, Now herein is something very surprising, that you know not whence he is, though he hath opened my eyes.
\v 31 Now we know that God doth not hearken to sinners: but if any man be a devout worshipper, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
\v 32 From the creation of the world hath it never been heard, that any man opened the eyes of one born blind.
\v 33 If this man were not from God, he could not do any thing.
\v 34 They answered and said unto him, Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
\v 35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, said to him, Believest thou in the Son of God?
\v 36 The man answered and said, Who is he, Sir, that I might believe on him?
\v 37 Then said Jesus him, Thou hast even seen him, and he that is now talking with thee is the very person.
\v 38 Then he said, Lord, I believe: and worshipped him.
\p
\v 39 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they who see not may see; and they who see become blind.
\v 40 And some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, Are we blind also?
\v 41 Jesus said to them, If ye were blind, ye should not have had sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin is permanent.

\v 1 VERILY, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheep-fold, but getteth in some other way, that person is a thief and a robber.
\v 2 He that entereth by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
\v 3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own peculiar sheep by name, and leadeth them forth.
\v 4 And when he bringeth out his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: because they know his voice.
\v 5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will fly from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
\v 6 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they knew nothing of the things which he spake to them.
\p
\v 7 Therefore Jesus said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that I am the door of the sheep.
\v 8 All, as many as have gone before me, are thieves and robbers: but the sheep hearkened not to them.
\v 9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved; and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
\v 10 The thief cometh not but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.
\v 11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.
\v 12 But the hireling, and he that is not the shepherd, whose own property the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth; and the wolf seizes upon them, and disperseth the sheep.
\v 13 Now the hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
\v 14 I am the good shepherd, and know my own \add sheep\add*, and am known of my own.
\v 15 As the Father knoweth me, so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
\v 16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: these also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, one shepherd.
\v 17 Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.
\v 18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment I have received from my Father.
\p
\v 19 There was therefore a division again among the Jews, on account of these sayings.
\v 20 Then many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hearken to him?
\v 21 Others said, These are not the discourses of a demoniac. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
\p
\v 22 Then was the feast of dedication at Jerusalem, and it was winter.
\v 23 And Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s portico.
\v 24 Then the Jews came about him, and said to him, How long dost thou keep our soul in suspense? If thou art the Messiah, tell us plainly.
\v 25 Jesus answered them; I told you, and ye believed not: the works which I do in the name of my Father, they bear witness of me.
\v 26 But ye believe not, for ye are not of my sheep, as I told you.
\v 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
\v 28 and I give unto them everlasting life and they shall never perish to eternity, and no person shall pluck them out of my hand.
\v 29 My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all and no one shall pluck them out of my Father’s hand.
\v 30 I and my Father are one.
\p
\v 31 Then the Jews again brought stones, in order to stone him.
\v 32 Jesus said unto them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which work of these are ye going to stone me?
\v 33 The Jews answered him, For a good work we do not stone thee; but for blasphemy; and that thou, being merely a man, makest thyself God.
\v 34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, “I said ye are gods?”
\v 35 If he called those gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
\v 36 do ye say of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest because I said, I am the Son of God?
\v 37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
\v 38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.
\v 39 Then sought they again to apprehend him and he departed out of their reach,
\v 40 and went again beyond Jordan, unto the place where John at first baptised; and there he abode.
\v 41 And many came to him, and said, That John indeed performed no miracle: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true.
\v 42 And many believed on him there.

\v 1 NOW there was a sick man, Lazarus, of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
\v 2 (It was the Mary who had anointed the Lord with the balm, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
\v 3 The sisters therefore sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
\v 4 When Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not for death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.
\p
\v 5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
\v 6 Then, though he heard he was ill, yet notwithstanding he abode in the same place where he was two days.
\v 7 But after that he saith to his disciples, Let us go again into Judea.
\v 8 The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews have just now sought to stone thee; and art thou going thither again?
\v 9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he doth not stumble, because he seeth the light of this world.
\v 10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light with him.
\v 11 These things said he: and after that he saith to them, Our friend Lazarus is asleep; but I go to waken him up.
\v 12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he is asleep, he will recover.
\v 13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they apprehended that he spake of taking rest in sleep.
\v 14 Then Jesus therefore told them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
\v 15 And I rejoice on your account that I was not there, in order that ye may believe; but let us go to him.
\v 16 Then said Thomas, (called Didymus, the twin,) to his fellow-disciples, Let us go too, that we may die with him.
\p
\v 17 Then Jesus, when he came; found that he had already lain in the tomb four days.
\v 18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
\v 19 and many of the Jews had come with the women who were about Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
\v 20 Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, met him: but Mary sat in the house.
\v 21 And Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
\v 22 But even now I know, that whatsoever things thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.
\v 23 Jesus saith to her, Thy brother shall rise again.
\v 24 Martha saith to him, I know that he shall rise at the resurrection in the last day.
\v 25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
\v 26 and every one who is alive, and believeth in me, shall never die to eternity. Believest thou this?
\v 27 She saith to him, Yes, Lord I believe that thou art the Messiah, the Son of God, who cometh into the world.
\p
\v 28 So when she had thus spoken, she went away, and called her sister Mary privately, saying, The Master is near at hand, and calleth for thee.
\v 29 As soon as she heard it, she rose hastily, and came to him.
\p
\v 30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was on the spot where Martha had met him.
\v 31 Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, observing Mary, that she rose up hastily, and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb, to weep there.
\p
\v 32 When therefore Mary was come where Jesus was, beholding him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died!
\v 33 When Jesus then saw her weeping, and all the Jews who came with her lamenting, he groaned in spirit, and was himself greatly agitated:
\v 34 and he said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.
\v 35 Jesus wept.
\v 36 Then said the Jews, Behold, how he loved him!
\v 37 But some of them said, Could not this man, who openeth the eyes of the blind, have caused that this person should not have died?
\v 38 Then Jesus again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre. It was an excavation, and a stone lay upon it.
\v 39 Jesus saith, Remove the stone. The sister of the deceased, Martha, said to him, Lord, he is by this time putrid: for he hath been dead four days.
\v 40 Jesus saith unto her, Did I not tell thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?
\v 41 Then they removed the stone where the deceased was lying. And Jesus lifted his eyes upwards, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me!
\v 42 And I knew that thou always dost hear me: but for the sake of the multitude standing by I spake, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
\v 43 And when he had thus spoken, with a loud voice he cried, Lazarus, come forth!
\v 44 And the deceased came forth, his feet and his hands wrapped with the linen swathes; and his face bound round with a napkin. Jesus saith to them, Loose him, and let him go!
\p
\v 45 Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what Jesus had done, believed on him.
\v 46 But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.
\v 47 The chief priests and Pharisees therefore called the sanhedrim together, and said, What are we about? for this man is doing many miracles.
\v 48 If we suffer him to go on thus, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come, and take away both our place and nation.
\v 49 Then one particular person of them, Caiaphas, being the high-priest of that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing,
\v 50 nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation be not destroyed.
\v 51 And this he spake not from himself: but being the high-priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;
\v 52 and not for that nation only, but that he should collect into one body the children of God wherever dispersed.
\v 53 Then from that day they consulted together how they might kill him.
\p
\v 54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but went thence into the country bordering on the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he abode with his disciples.
\v 55 Now the passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, in order to purify themselves.
\v 56 Then they sought for Jesus, and said one to another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?
\v 57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any person knew where he was, they should declare it, that they might apprehend him.
\c 12
\cl CHAP. XII.
\p
\v 1 JESUS then before the days of the passover came to Bethany, where the deceased Lazarus was, whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 2 Therefore they made him a supper there; and Martha waited: but Lazarus was one of those who sat at table with him.
\v 3 Then Mary taking a pound of unadulterated balm of nard, very valuable, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
\v 4 Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, who was preparing to betray him,
\v 5 Wherefore was not this aromatic ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?
\v 6 Now he said this, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and kept the purse, and carried the money put therein.
\v 7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: for the day of my burial hath she reserved this.
\v 8 For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.
\p
\v 9 Then the whole multitude of the Jews knew that he was there: and they came not for the sake of Jesus only, but also that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 10 Then the chief priests consulted how they might kill Lazarus also;
\v 11 because on his account many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
\p
\v 12 On the morrow a great multitude who came to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
\v 13 took branches of palm, and went out to meet him, and cried, Hosanna! blessed is the king of Israel, that cometh in the name of the Lord.
\p
\v 14 Then Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon it; as it is written,
\v 15 “Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on the foal of an ass.”
\v 16 These things indeed knew not his disciples at first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.
\p
\v 17 Then the multitude that was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bore their testimony.
\v 18 Therefore also the multitude met him, because they had heard that he had done this miracle.
\v 19 Then said the Pharisees among themselves, Do ye not perceive that ye gain no advantage? behold, the world is gone after him.
\p
\v 20 Now there were certain Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast:
\v 21 these then came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida, of Galilee, and they asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.
\v 22 Philip comes and speaks to Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
\v 23 Then Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
\v 24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat falling on the earth undergo a deathlike change, it abideth single: but if it \add thus\add* die, it beareth abundant produce.
\v 25 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, shall preserve it to life eternal.
\v 26 If a man will be my servant, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my servant be: and if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.
\v 27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
\v 28 Father, glorify thy name! Then came a voice from heaven, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
\v 29 The multitude that stood by, and heard it, said that it was thunder: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.
\v 30 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not for my sake, but for your’s.
\v 31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the ruler of this world be ejected out \add of it\add*.
\v 32 And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.
\v 33 And this he said, signifying by what death he should die.
\p
\v 34 Then the multitude answered him, We have heard out of the law, that the Messiah abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, That the Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
\v 35 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest the darkness overtake you: he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not even whither he is going.
\v 36 While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of the light. These things spake Jesus, and going away, concealed himself from them.
\p
\v 37 Now, though he had done so many miracles before them, they believed not on him:
\v 38 that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, “Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
\v 39 For this reason they could not believe, because Isaiah had said again;
\v 40 “He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts; lest they should see with their eyes, and understand with the heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.”
\v 41 These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
\v 42 However, notwithstanding, many even of the rulers believed on him; but on account of the Pharisees they did not make open profession, lest they should be put out of the synagogues:
\v 43 for they loved honour from men, more than honour from God.
\p
\v 44 Then Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
\v 45 And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.
\v 46 I am come a light into the world, that every one who believeth on me should not abide in darkness.
\v 47 And if any man, hearing my words, believeth not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
\v 48 He that sets me at nought, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: even the word which I have spoken, the same shall judge him at the last day.
\v 49 Because I have not spoken of myself; but the Farther who has sent me, he gave me commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
\v 50 And I know that his commandment is life eternal: therefore the things which I speak to you, just as the Father spake to me, so speak I.

\cl CHAP. XIII.
\p
\v 1 NOW before the feast of the passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour was come, that he should go out of this world to the Father, having loved his peculiar people that are in the world, he loved them to the end.
\v 2 And supper being served, (the devil having now injected into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, that he should betray him;)
\v 3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came out from God, and was going to God;
\v 4 he rises from supper, and lays aside his garments, and taking a towel, he wound it about himself.
\v 5 Then he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was begirt.
\v 6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and he saith to him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
\v 7 Jesus answered and said to him, What I am doing thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
\v 8 Peter saith to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet: no, never. Jesus answered him, Except I wash thee, thou hast no part with me.
\v 9 Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
\v 10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed hath need only to wash his feet, for he is entirely clean: and ye are clean, but not all.
\v 11 (For he knew who would betray him; therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.)
\v 12 When therefore he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done unto you?
\v 13 Ye call me Master, and Lord: and ye speak truly; for such I am.
\v 14 If therefore I have washed your feet, though the Lord and the Master; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.
\v 15 For I have given you an example, that just as I have done to you, ye should do also.
\v 16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his master; nor the messenger greater than him that sent him.
\v 17 If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye practise them.
\v 18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel against me.
\v 19 Now I tell you previously, before this comes to pass, that, when it cometh to pass, ye may believe that I am.
\v 20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I shall send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.
\p
\v 21 As Jesus was speaking these words, he was greatly agitated in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
\v 22 Then the disciples looked one at another, doubting of whom he spake.
\v 23 Now there was one of the disciples reclining on the bosom of Jesus, whom Jesus loved.
\v 24 Therefore Simon Peter gave him a significant look, that he should inquire of Jesus, which of them it should be of whom he spake.
\v 25 And he leaning on the breast of Jesus, said to him, Lord, which is it?
\v 26 Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give this morsel of bread, when I have dipped it. And dipping the morsel of bread, he gave it unto Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
\v 27 And after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus saith to him, What thou doest, do quickly.
\v 28 Now none of those who sat at table knew wherefore he had spoken to him.
\v 29 For some supposed, as Judas kept the purse, that Jesus was saying to him, Buy what we need for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
\v 30 Having then received the sop, he went out immediately: now it was night.
\p
\v 31 When therefore he was gone, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
\v 32 If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him with himself, and immediately glorify him.
\v 33 My dear children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: as I said to the Jews, Whither I am going, ye cannot come; so say I now to you.
\v 34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; even as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
\v 35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
\p
\v 36 Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, Whither art thou going? Jesus answered him, Whither I am going, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me hereafter.
\v 37 Peter saith to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.
\v 38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Verily, verily, I tell thee, the cock will not crow, before thou shalt deny me thrice.

\p
\v 1 LET not your hearts be troubled: trust in God, and trust in me.
\v 2 In my Father’s house are many mansions: and if not, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
\v 3 And if I go and prepare you a place, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
\v 4 And whither I am going ye know, and the way ye know.
\p
\v 5 Thomas saith to him, We know not whither thou art going; and how can we know the way?
\v 6 Jesus saith to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh to the Father, but by me.
\v 7 If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father: and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him.
\p
\v 8 Philip saith to him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
\v 9 Jesus saith to him, Am I all this while with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou, Shew us the Father?
\v 10 Dost thou not believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? the words which I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father, who dwelleth in me, he performeth these works.
\v 11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: and at least believe me on account of the works themselves.
\v 12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works which I do shall he do also; yea, and greater than these shall he do; because I go to the Father.
\v 13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
\v 14 If ye ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
\v 15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.
\v 16 And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
\v 17 the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; because he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
\v 18 I will not leave you orphans: I am coming to you.
\v 19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.
\v 20 In that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
\v 21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he is the person who loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
\p
\v 22 Then Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not unto the world?
\v 23 Jesus answered and said to him, If any man love me, he will observe my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him.
\v 24 He that loveth me not, doth not observe my sayings: and the word which ye are hearing is not mine, but of him that sent me.
\v 25 These things have I spoken to you, while I continue among you.
\v 26 But the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, which I have spoken to you.
\v 27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I to you. Let not your heart be agitated, nor shrink back through fear.
\v 28 Ye have heard that I told you, I am going away, though I am coming again to you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I am going to the Father: because my Father is greater than I.
\v 29 And now I have informed you before it comes to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe.
\v 30 I shall not speak many things more with you: for the ruler of this world is coming, though in me he hath no part.
\v 31 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father hath given me commandment, so I do. Arise, let us go hence.

\p
\v 1 I AM the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
\v 2 Every branch in me that beareth no fruit, he taketh it away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he pruneth it clean, that it may bring forth more fruit.
\v 3 Ye are already clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
\v 4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine: so neither can ye, except ye abide in me.
\v 5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, this person beareth much fruit: because without me ye can do nothing.
\v 6 If any man abide not in me, he is cast out as a branch, and withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
\v 7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done for you.
\v 8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye should bring forth much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.
\v 9 Just as the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you: abide in my love.
\v 10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and as I abide in his love.
\v 11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may abide in you, and your joy may be full.
\v 12 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, just as I have loved you.
\v 13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
\v 14 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever things I command you.
\v 15 I no more call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his master is doing: but I have called you friends because I have made known to you all things which I have heard of my Father.
\v 16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you that ye should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should be permanent: that so whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he may give it you.
\v 17 These things I command you, that ye love one another.
\v 18 If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before you.
\v 19 If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have elected you out of the world, for this very cause the world hateth you.
\v 20 Remember the word which I spake unto you, The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also; if they have observed my words, they will observe your’s also.
\v 21 But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.
\v 22 Had I not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.
\v 23 He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
\v 24 If I had not done among them the works which no other ever did, they would not have had sin: but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.
\v 25 But it is in order that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law, “They hated me without a cause.”
\v 26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:
\v 27 and ye too shall bear your testimony, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
\c 16
\cl CHAP. XVI.
\p
\v 1 THESE things have I spoken, that ye might not be stumbled.
\v 2 They will put you out of their synagogues: yea, the hour is coming, that every one who killeth you will think he offers God a sacred service.
\v 3 And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
\v 4 But these things have I spoken to you, that when the hour is come, ye may remember the same for I had told you. But these things I told you not at the beginning, because I was with you.
\v 5 But now I am going away to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither art thou going?
\v 6 But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
\v 7 Yet I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I went not away, the Comforter would not come to you; but if I go, I will send him unto you.
\v 8 And when he cometh, he will convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment:
\v 9 of sin first, because they believe not in me;
\v 10 then of righteousness, because I am going to the Father, so ye see me no more;
\v 11 and of judgment, because the ruler of this world hath sentence pronounced on him.
\p
\v 12 I have many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them just now.
\v 13 But when he is come, the Spirit of truth, he will conduct you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever things he shall hear, he shall speak: and he will declare to you the things that shall come hereafter.
\v 14 He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
\v 15 All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore I said, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
\v 16 A little while longer, and ye shall not see me: and again a little while, and ye shall see me, because I am going to the Father.
\p
\v 17 Then said some of the disciples unto each other, What is this which he saith to us, A little while longer, and ye shall not see me: and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and this, because I am going to the Father?
\v 18 They said therefore, What is this which he saith, This little while? we know not what he means.
\p
\v 19 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Are ye questioning among yourselves concerning this declaration, which I spake, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again a little while, and ye shall see me?
\v 20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be very sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
\v 21 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when the little son is born, she no more remembers the anguish, for joy that a man is brought into the world.
\v 22 And ye therefore have indeed at present sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall be made glad, and your joy no man taketh from you.
\v 23 And in that hour ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, That whatsoever things ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you.
\v 24 Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be complete.
\v 25 These things have I spoken to you in parables: but the hour is coming when I will no more speak to you in parables, but will plainly inform you respecting the Father.
\v 26 In that day ye shall ask in my name: and I do not say to you, I will entreat the Father for you:
\v 27 for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
\v 28 I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I am leaving the world, and going to the Father.
\p
\v 29 His disciples said unto him, Lo! now thou speakest plainly, and speakest in no-wise proverbial.
\v 30 Now we know that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any person should ask thee: by this we believe that thou hast come forth from God.
\v 31 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
\v 32 Behold, the hour is coming, yea, it is already come, that ye shall be dispersed, each after his own concerns, and shall leave me alone: though I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
\v 33 These things have I spoken to you, that ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good courage; I have overcome the world.
\c 17
\cl CHAP. XVII.
\p
\v 1 THESE things spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee:
\v 2 even as thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that with regard to all those whom thou hast given him, he should give to them eternal life:
\v 3 and this is eternal life, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou hast sent, Jesus, the Messiah.
\v 4 I have glorified thee upon earth: I have completed the work which thou gavest me to perform.
\v 5 And now, Father, do thou glorify me with thyself in the glory which I held with thee before the world was.
\v 6 I have made known thy name to the persons whom thou gavest me out of the world: for thee they had a being, and to me thou hast given them; and thy word have they kept.
\v 7 Now have they known, that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee.
\v 8 For the declarations which thou gavest to me I have delivered to them; and they have received them, and have known assuredly that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou hast sent me.
\v 9 I entreat for them: I make no request for the world; but for those thou hast given me; for they are thine.
\v 10 And all mine are thine, and thine mine; and I have been glorified in them.
\v 11 And now no longer am I in this world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to thee. Holy Father! preserve them for thy name’s sake whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.
\v 12 When I was with them in the world, I preserved them by thy name: those whom thou hast given me have I guarded, and not one of them is perished, except the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
\v 13 But now I am coming to thee; and I am speaking these things in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
\v 14 I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
\v 15 I entreat not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest preserve them from the wicked one.
\v 16 They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
\v 17 Sanctify them by thy truth: thy word is truth.
\v 18 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I sent them into the world.
\v 19 And for them I devote myself, that they also might be sanctified by the truth.
\v 20 And not for them do I make request only, but also for those who shall believe in me through their word;
\v 21 that all may be one; as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee, that these also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
\v 22 And I have given them the glory, which thou hast given me; that they may be one, even as we are one:
\v 23 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.
\v 24 Father, those whom thou hast given me, I will that where I am they may also be with me; that they may behold my glory, which thou gavest me: because thou hast loved me before the foundation of the world.
\p
\v 25 Righteous Father! though the world hath not known thee, yet I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.
\v 26 And I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.

\v 1 HAVING thus spoken, Jesus went out with his disciples beyond the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into which he went himself, and his disciples.
\v 2 Now Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for frequently had Jesus consorted with his disciples there.
\v 3 Then Judas having taken a band of soldiers, and the inferior officers of the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and arms.
\v 4 Jesus therefore, conscious of all things that were coming upon him, going forward, said to them, Whom are ye seeking?
\v 5 They answered him, Jesus the Nazarean. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. Then stood also Judas, who betrayed him, with these men.
\v 6 As he then spake to them, I am he, they retreated backward, and fell flat on the ground.
\v 7 Again therefore he demanded of them, Whom seek ye? Then they said, Jesus the Nazarean.
\v 8 Jesus answered, I told you that I am he: if therefore ye are seeking me, permit these to go away:
\v 9 that the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, That of those whom thou hast given me, I have not lost one of them.
\p
\v 10 Then Simon Peter having a sword, drew it, and struck a servant of the high-priest, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant’s name was Malchas.
\v 11 Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up thy sword into the scabbard: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
\p
\v 12 The band therefore, and the chief captain, and the inferior officers of the Jews, seized on Jesus, and bound him,
\v 13 and led him away to Annas first; for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high-priest of that year.
\v 14 Now Caiaphas was the person who had given his advice to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should be destroyed instead of the people.
\p
\v 15 Now Simon Peter had followed Jesus, and another disciple: and that disciple was acquainted with the high-priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high-priest.
\v 16 But Peter stood without at the door. Then that other disciple, who was acquainted with the high-priest, went out, and spoke to the porteress, and introduced Peter.
\v 17 Then said the damsel who kept the door to Peter, Art not thou also one of the disciples of this man? He saith, I am not.
\v 18 Now the servants and inferior officers having made a fire, for it was cold, stood and warmed themselves: and there stood Peter with them, and warmed himself.
\v 19 The high-priest then questioned Jesus concerning his disciples, and respecting his doctrine.
\v 20 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews resorted; and in secret have I spoken nothing.
\v 21 Why dost thou question me? ask those who have heard me, what I have spoken to them: lo, they know what I said.
\v 22 As he was thus speaking, one of the servants who stood by him gave Jesus a slap on the face, saying, Dost thou answer the high-priest in this fashion?
\v 23 Jesus replied to him, If I have spoken in an improper manner, bear witness of the evil deed: but if properly, why strikest thou me?
\v 24 Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high-priest.
\p
\v 25 Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then said they to him, Art not thou also one of this man’s disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.
\v 26 One of the servants of the high-priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did I not see thee in the garden with him?
\v 27 Then again Peter denied: and instantly the cock crew.
\p
\v 28 Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium: and it was early: and they themselves went not into the praetorium, that they should not be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
\v 29 Pilate then came out to them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?
\v 30 They answered and said to him, If this fellow had not been a malefactor, we should not have delivered him up to thee.
\v 31 Pilate then said to them, Take him yourselves, and according to your own law judge him. The Jews then said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
\v 32 that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, intimating by what manner of death he should die.
\p
\v 33 Pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium, and called Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the king of the Jews?
\v 34 Jesus answered him, Dost thou speak this from thyself, or did others speak to thee concerning me?
\v 35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee to me: what hast thou done?
\v 36 Jesus replied, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom had been of this world, then would my servants have struggled hard, that I should not have been delivered up to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from hence.
\v 37 Then said Pilate unto him. Art thou not a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. For this end I was born, and for this I came into the world, that I should be a witness for the truth. Every one who is of the truth heareth my voice.
\v 38 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And having thus spoken, he went out again unto the Jews and saith to them, I find no fault in him.
\v 39 But ye have a custom, that I should release to you one person at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
\v 40 Then again they all clamoured, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
\c 19
\cl CHAP. XIX.
\p
\v 1 THEN Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
\v 2 And the soldiers having platted a crown of thorns, put it on his head, and they clothed him in a purple robe,
\v 3 and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they gave him slaps on the face with their hands.
\v 4 Then again went Pilate out, and said to them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find in him no fault at all.
\v 5 Then came Jesus out, bearing the thorny crown, and the purple robe. And he said to them, Behold the man!
\v 6 When the chief priests therefore and the officers saw him, they cried vociferously, saying, Crucify him! crucify him! Pilate saith to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I have not found in him a fault.
\v 7 The Jews replied to him, We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, because he hath made himself the Son of God.
\v 8 When Pilate then heard this saying, he was the more afraid:
\v 9 and entered into the praetorium again, and saith to Jesus, From whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
\v 10 Then saith Pilate to him, Dost thou not speak to me? dost thou not know that I have power to crucify thee, and that I have power to release thee?
\v 11 Jesus answered, Thou wouldest have had no authority over me, unless it had been given thee from above: for this reason, he that hath delivered me up to thee hath the greater crime.
\v 12 Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews clamoured, saying, If thou release this fellow, thou art no friend of Caesar’s: every one who professes himself a king, speaks in opposition to Caesar.
\p
\v 13 When Pilate therefore heard this speech, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat, in a place called the Stone Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
\v 14 And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith to the Jews, Behold your King!
\v 15 But they cried vociferously, Away with him, away! crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
\p
\v 16 Then delivered he him therefore unto them, that he should be crucified. And they took Jesus and led him away.
\v 17 And carrying his cross he went forth to a place called the Place of a Skull, which in the Hebrew is termed Golgotha:
\v 18 where they crucified him, and two others with him, on this side and on that, and in the midst Jesus.
\v 19 And Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And this was the writing: JESUS THE NAZAREAN, THE KING OF THE JEWS,
\v 20 This title then many of the Jews read: for the spot where Jesus was crucified was nigh unto the city: and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.
\v 21 The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
\v 22 Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.
\p
\v 23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, for each soldier a part; and his vest: now the vest was without a seam, woven from the upper parts throughout the whole.
\v 24 They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, “They parted my garments among them, and for my vest they cast lots.” So the soldiers therefore did these things.
\p
\v 25 Now beside the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.
\v 26 When Jesus then beheld his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing by, he saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
\v 27 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home.
\p
\v 28 After this, Jesus, conscious that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.
\v 29 Now there was placed a vessel full of vinegar: they then filling a spunge with the vinegar, and putting it on a stick of hyssop, carried it to his mouth.
\v 30 When therefore Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and inclining his head, he surrendered up his spirit.
\p
\v 31 The Jews therefore, as it was the preparation, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, (for that sabbath-day was a great day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
\v 32 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him.
\v 33 But when they came to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead, they brake not his legs:
\v 34 but one of the soldiers with his lance pierced his side, and immediately there gushed out blood and water.
\v 35 And he that saw it bore witness, and we know that his testimony is true: and he himself is conscious that he speaketh what is true, that ye might believe.
\v 36 Now these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled, “A bone of him shall not be broken.”
\v 37 And again another scripture saith, “They shall look on him whom they have pierced.”
\p
\v 38 And after these things Joseph of Arimathea, (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews,) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus and Pilate permitted him. Then he came and took away the body of Jesus.
\v 39 And Nicodemus, who had come to Jesus by night formerly, came also, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred weight.
\p
\v 40 Then they took the body, and bound it with swathes together with the aromatics, as the custom is with the Jews to bury.
\v 41 And there was near the spot were he was crucified a garden and in the garden a new tomb, wherein no person had ever yet been laid.
\v 42 Because of the preparation of the Jews therefore, they laid Jesus there; for the sepulchre was just by.
\c 20
\cl CHAP. XX.
\p
\v 1 AND on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalen came very early, whilst yet some darkness remained, to the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
\v 2 She therefore runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
\v 3 Then Peter went out, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
\v 4 And they two ran together: and the other disciple ran before more swiftly than Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.
\v 5 And stooping forward, he sees the swathing clothes lying there; yet he did not go in.
\v 6 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and saw the swathing clothes lying,
\v 7 and the napkin, which had been round his head, not laid with the linen swathes, but apart folded up in another place.
\v 8 Then went in also the other disciple, who had come the first to the sepulchre, and saw, and believed.
\v 9 Though not even yet had they known the scripture, that he should rise from the dead.
\v 10 Then the disciples went back again to their companions.
\v 11 But Mary stood at the sepulchre, without, weeping: as therefore she wept, she bent forward towards the sepulchre.
\v 12 And saw two angels in white, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
\v 13 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
\v 14 And as she thus spoke, she turned about, and beheld Jesus standing by, and knew not that it was Jesus.
\v 15 Then Jesus said to her, Woman, why art thou weeping? whom art thou seeking? She, supposing that it was the gardener, said to him, Sir, if thou hast carried him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
\v 16 Jesus saith to her, Mary! Starting round, she said to him, Rabboni! that is, Master!
\v 17 Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I have not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and tell them, I am ascending to my Father, and your Father; to my God, and your God.
\v 18 Mary Magdalen cometh declaring to the disciples, that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things to her.
\p
\v 19 When the evening therefore was come, on the same first day of the week, and the doors being fastened where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said unto them, Peace be to you.
\v 20 And thus speaking, he shewed them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord.
\v 21 Jesus therefore spake to them again, Peace be unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
\v 22 And so speaking, he breathed on them, and said, Receive the Holy Ghost:
\v 23 whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins soever ye retain, they are retained.
\p
\v 24 Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, the twin, was not with them when Jesus came.
\v 25 Then the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Except I should see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I shall never believe it.
\v 26 And eight days after, his disciples were again within, and Thomas with them: Jesus cometh, though the doors were fastened, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.
\v 27 Afterwards he spake to Thomas, Bring hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and take thy hand, and thrust into my side: and be not incredulous, but a believer.
\v 28 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God!
\v 29 Jesus saith to him, Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, hast thou believed: blessed are they who though they have not seen me, yet have believed.
\p
\v 30 Now many other miracles did Jesus therefore also in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
\v 31 but these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.

\v 1 AFTER these things Jesus again shewed himself to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he appeared in the following manner:
\v 2 Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, the twin, and Nathaniel who was of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of the disciples were together.
\v 3 Simon Peter said to them, I am going a-fishing. They say to him, We too will go with thee. They went out, and got on board the vessel immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
\v 4 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood upon the beach: yet the disciples had not discovered that it was Jesus.
\v 5 Then saith Jesus unto them, My youths, have ye any thing eatable? They answered him, No.
\v 6 Then he said to them, Shoot the net on the right side of the vessel, and ye shall find fish. They shot it therefore, and now they were not able to drag it in from the quantity of fishes.
\v 7 Then said that disciple whom Jesus loved to Peter, It is the Lord! Then Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, girt his coat round him, (for he was stripped,) and threw himself into the sea.
\v 8 And the other disciples came in the little vessel, (for they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with the fishes.
\v 9 When therefore they were come to land, they saw a fire laid, and a fish upon it, and a loaf.
\v 10 Jesus saith to them, Bring some of the fish which ye have just caught.
\v 11 Simon Peter went aboard, and drew the net to land full of large fishes, to the number of a hundred and fifty-three: and though they were so many, yet was not the net rent.
\v 12 Jesus saith to them, Come, dine. Now not one of the disciples dared inquire, Who art thou? conscious that it was the Lord.
\v 13 Then Jesus cometh, and taketh the loaf, and distributed to them, and of the fish in like manner.
\v 14 Now this was the third time Jesus had shewed himself to the disciples, after he rose from the dead.
\p
\v 15 When therefore they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him, Yes, Lord! thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my lambs.
\v 16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith to him, Yes, Lord! thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
\v 17 He saith to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee! Jesus saith to him, Feed my sheep.
\v 18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast a younger man, thou didst gird up thyself, and go about whithersoever thy choice led thee: but when thou shalt grow old, another person extending thy hands, shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.
\v 19 This he told him, to intimate by what kind of death he should glorify God. And having thus spoken, he said to him, Follow me.
\v 20 Now Peter, turning about, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also at the supper reclined on his bosom, and said, Lord, which is the person who betrayeth thee?
\v 21 Peter looking at him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and what will become of this man?
\v 22 Jesus saith to him, If I will that he abide till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.
\v 23 Then this speech went forth among the disciples, as though this disciple was not to die: yet Jesus had not said to him, That he shall not die; but, If I will that he abide till I come, what is that to thee?
\p
\v 24 This is the disciple who is testifing of these things, and hath written these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
\v 25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if every particular was written, I am of opinion that the world itself would not be capable of retaining the books which should be written. Amen.
