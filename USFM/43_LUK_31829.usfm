\mt THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE.

\cl CHAP. I.
\p
\v 1 SINCE many have attempted to compose a narrative of facts, confirmed to us by the fullest evidence:
\v 2 exactly as they delivered them to us, who were eve witnesses from the first, and ministers of the word;
\v 3 it seemed right to me also, having obtained accurate knowledge of all things from above, to write to thee in regular order, most excellent Theophilus,
\v 4 to the intent that thou mayest clearly know the certainty of those matters, concerning which thou hast been instructed.
\p
\v 5 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abiah: and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elisabeth.
\v 6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
\v 7 And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were far advanced in years.
\v 8 And it came to pass, as he discharged his priestly office in the order of his periodical ministration before God,
\v 9 according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to his lot to burn the incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
\v 10 And all the multitude of people was praying without, at the time of the burning the incense.
\v 11 And an angel of the Lord appeared to him standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
\v 12 And Zacharias was agitated greatly at the sight, and fear fell upon him.
\v 13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bring thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
\v 14 And it shall give thee joy and exultation; and many shall rejoice at his birth:
\v 15 for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord; and he shall never drink wine, nor any intoxicating liquor; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.
\v 16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord, their God.
\v 17 And he shall go forth before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to convert the hearts of fathers with their children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people ready for the Lord.
\p
\v 18 And Zacharias said to the angel, By what shall I know this? for I am old, and my wife far advanced in her age.
\v 19 And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I have been sent to speak to thee, and to proclaim these glad tidings to thee.
\v 20 And behold, thou shalt be dumb, and unable to speak, until that day when these things shall come to pass, because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled at their exact time.
\p
\v 21 And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.
\v 22 And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he himself made signs to them, and continued deaf and dumb.
\v 23 And it came to pass, when the days of his ministry were fulfilled, he went to his own house.
\v 24 And after those days Elisabeth his wife conceived, and kept herself in retirement five months, saying,
\v 25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days in which he looked upon me to take away my reproach among men.
\p
\v 26 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, the name of which was Nazareth,
\v 27 to a virgin of the house of David, betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph; and the virgin’s name was Mary.
\v 28 And the angel coming in to her said, All hail! O thou highly favoured one! the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
\v 29 And when she saw him, she was greatly agitated at his address: and reasoned in herself what kind of salutation this could be.
\v 30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God.
\v 31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS.
\v 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father;
\v 33 and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
\v 34 And Mary said, How shall this be, seeing I know not man?
\v 35 And the angel answering said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee; wherefore also the Holy One that shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God.
\v 36 And, behold, Elisabeth thy cousin, she also hath conceived in her old age: and this is the fifth month \add of pregnancy\add* with her who was called barren.
\v 37 For there is nothing impossible with God.
\v 38 Then said Mary, Behold a servant of the Lord, be it to me according to thy declaration. And the angel departed from her.
\p
\v 39 Then Mary arose in those days, and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah,
\v 40 and entered into the house of Zachariah, and saluted Elisabeth.
\v 41 And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped for joy in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:
\v 42 and she exclaimed with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
\v 43 And whence is this favour shewn me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
\v 44 For, lo! as the voice of thy salutation reached my ears, the babe leaped for joy in my womb.
\v 45 And blessed is she that hath believed; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things told her from the Lord.
\p
\v 46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,
\v 47 and my spirit hath exulted in God my Saviour:
\v 48 for he hath looked upon the lowly state of his maid-servant: for, lo! henceforth shall all generations pronounce me blessed.
\v 49 For the Mighty One hath done great things for me; and holy is his name.
\v 50 And his mercy is upon those who fear him, from generation to generation.
\v 51 He hath displayed strength from his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
\v 52 He hath cast down potentates from the throne, and hath exalted the lowly.
\v 53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.
\v 54 He hath succoured Israel his servant, that he might be mindful of mercy for ever;
\v 55 as he had spoken to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed.
\v 56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto her home.
\p
\v 57 Now Elisabeth’s time was up that she should be delivered; and she brought a son.
\v 58 And her neighbours and her relations heard, that the Lord had magnified his mercy upon her; and they congratulated her.
\v 59 And it came to pass, on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him after the name of his father, Zacharias.
\v 60 And his mother spake and said, No; but he shall be called John.
\v 61 And they said to her, There is not one among thy relations, who is called by this name.
\v 62 And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
\v 63 And desiring a writing tablet, he wrote, saying, John is his name. And they were all surprised.
\v 64 Instantly then his mouth was opened, and his tongue loosed, and he burst out in praises to God.
\v 65 And great awe fell on all those who dwelt around them: and in all the mountainous country of Judea, all these circumstances were the subject of conversation.
\v 66 And all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, Well! what a child will this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.
\p
\v 67 And Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,
\v 68 Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel; for he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people;
\v 69 and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David:
\v 70 as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been from the beginning:
\v 71 even preservation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
\v 72 to perform mercy towards our fathers, and to remember his own holy covenant:
\v 73 the oath which he sware to Abraham our father,
\v 74 to give us, that we, secure from fear, rescued from the hands of our enemies, should serve him,
\v 75 in righteousness and holiness before him, all the days of our life.
\v 76 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most High; for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;
\v 77 to give the knowledge of salvation to his people, by the remission of their sins,
\v 78 through the bowels of mercy of our God; with which he hath visited us, as the dawn of the morning from on high,
\v 79 to illumine those who sat in darkness, and in the shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace.
\v 80 And the child grew, and became mighty in spirit, and was in the deserts until the days of his public exhibition to Israel.

\p
\v 1 NOW it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that the whole land should be registered.
\v 2 (And this first enrolment was made by Cyrenius, \add afterwards\add* governor of Syria)
\v 3 And all went to be registered, every one to his own city.
\v 4 Then Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; because he was of the house and family of David;
\v 5 to be enregistered with Mary, the wife espoused to him, who was big with child.
\v 6 And it came to pass, while they were there, that her time was up, that she should be delivered.
\v 7 And she brought forth a son, her first-born, and wrapped him in swaddling-clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
\p
\v 8 And there were shepherds in that country abiding in the open air, and keeping guard over their flock by night.
\v 9 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were exceedingly affrighted.
\v 10 And the angel said unto them, Be not affrighted: for, behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, which shall be for all the people.
\v 11 Because this day there is born for you a Saviour, which is Messiah, the Lord, in the city of David.
\v 12 And this shall be a sign for you; Ye shall find the babe in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger.
\v 13 And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying,
\v 14 Glory in the highest heavens to God! and upon earth, peace! towards men complacence.
\v 15 And it came to pass, as the angels went from them into heaven, the men, the shepherds, said also to each other, Let us now go to Bethlehem, and see this thing which hath happened, which the Lord hath made known to us.
\v 16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe, lying in the manger:
\v 17 and when they saw it, they made a public report of the declaration delivered to them respecting this child.
\v 18 And all who heard it, marvelled at the things told them by the shepherds.
\v 19 But Mary carefully preserved all these declarations, laying them together in her heart, in order to apprehend their meaning.
\v 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen, exactly as had been told them.
\p
\v 21 And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising the child, his name also was called JESUS, the name imposed by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
\p
\v 22 And when the days of her purification were accomplished according to the law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;
\v 23 as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male child, that openeth the womb, shall be called holy to the Lord;
\v 24 and to offer a sacrifice, according to what is prescribed in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.
\p
\v 25 And, behold, there was a man at Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.
\v 26 And it had been divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, till he had seen the Lord’s Messiah.
\v 27 And he came by the spirit into the temple; just as the parents were bringing in the child Jesus, that they might do according to what was the custom of the law concerning him;
\v 28 and he took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
\v 29 Now dismiss thy servant, Lord, according to thy word, in peace;
\v 30 for my eyes have seen thy salvation,
\v 31 which thou hast prepared before the face of all people.
\v 32 A light to give revelation to the Gentiles, and glory to thy people Israel.
\p
\v 33 And Joseph and his mother were amazed at the things spoken concerning him.
\v 34 And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is appointed for the fall, and rising again of many in Israel; and for a marked object to be spoken against;
\v 35 (so shall a dart pierce through thy own soul) that the reasonings of many hearts may be laid open,
\p
\v 36 And there was Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asser: she was far advanced in old age, having lived but seven years with a husband, from her virgin state:
\v 37 though she was now a widow, of about eighty-four years, who departed not from the temple, attending the divine service, with fastings and prayers night and day:
\v 38 and at the very same moment coming up, she also in turn confessed the Lord, and spake of him to all who were expecting redemption in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 39 And when they had finished all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, into their own city Nazareth.
\v 40 And the child grew, and became endued with great powers of spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.
\p
\v 41 And his parents went annually to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.
\v 42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast.
\v 43 And when they had concluded the days, as they were returning, the child Jesus remained at Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother knew it not:
\v 44 but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they sought him among their relations and acquaintances;
\v 45 and not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem in search of him.
\v 46 And it came to pass after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions.
\v 47 And all who heard him, were in a transport of admiration, at his understanding and answers.
\v 48 And when they saw him, they were struck with surprise; and his mother said to him, Son, why hast thou behaved to us in this manner? lo! thy father and I have been seeking thee in anguish of heart.
\v 49 And he said unto them, Wherefore did ye seek me? did you not know, that I must be occupied with my Father’s affairs?
\v 50 And they understood not the meaning of what he spake to them.
\v 51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was in subjection to them: though his mother preserved all these sayings in her heart.
\v 52 And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men.

\p
\v 1 NOW in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene:
\v 2 when Annas and Caiaphas were high-priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness;
\v 3 and he came into all the country on the confines of Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;
\v 4 as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah, saying, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths strait:
\v 5 every valley shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be levelled, and the crooked ways made strait, and the rough roads smooth:
\v 6 and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.”
\v 7 He said, therefore, to the multitudes who came out to be baptised by him, Ye broods of vipers, who hath warned you to fly from the approaching wrath?
\v 8 Produce then fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say in yourselves, We have a father, even Abraham; for I say unto you, That God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
\v 9 But now is the ax laid even to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that produceth not good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire.
\p
\v 10 And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then shall we do?
\v 11 And he answering said to them, He that hath two coats, let him give to him that hath none; and he that hath provisions, let him do in like manner.
\v 12 Then came also the farmers of the taxes to be baptised, and they said unto him, Master, what shall we do?
\v 13 He said unto them, Exact nothing more than is appointed for you.
\v 14 And the military men also asked him, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Extort nothing by force; nor turn informers; and be content with your pay.
\p
\v 15 Now when the people were in expectation, and many reasoned in their hearts respecting John, whether he were the Messiah,
\v 16 John addressed himself to them all, saying, I indeed baptise you with water; but one mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie: he shall baptise you with the Holy Ghost and with fire;
\v 17 whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor, and collect the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.
\v 18 Thus in many and various discourses exhorting them, he preached the glad tidings of the gospel to the people.
\p
\v 19 Now Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him, on account of Herodias his brother Philip’s wife, and for all the other wicked actions which he had done,
\v 20 added this also to all the rest, and shut up John in prison.
\p
\v 21 Now it came to pass, at the time when John was baptising all the people, that Jesus also was baptised, and as he prayed, the heaven was opened,
\v 22 and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily form, like a dove, upon him, and a voice came from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.
\p
\v 23 And Jesus himself was about thirty years of age when he began his ministry, being (as was supposed the son of Joseph) of Heli,
\v 24 of Matthat, of Levi, of Melchi, of Janna, of Joseph,
\v 25 of Mattathias, of Amos, of Naum, of Esli, of Nagge,
\v 26 of Maath, of Mattathias, of Semei, of Joseph, of Juda,
\v 27 of Joanna, of Rhesa, of Zerubbabel, of Salathiel, of Neri,
\v 28 of Melchi, of Addi, of Cosam, of Elmodam, of Er,
\v 29 of Jose, of Eliezer, of Jorim, of Matthat, of Levi,
\v 30 of Simeon, of Judah, of Joseph, of Jonan, of Eliakim,
\v 31 of Melea, of Menan, of Mattatha, of Nathan, of David,
\v 32 of Jesse, of Obed, of Booz, of Salmon, of Naasson,
\v 33 of Aminadab, of Aram, of Esrom, of Phares, of Judah,
\v 34 of Jacob, of Isaac, of Abraham, of Terah, of Nachor,
\v 35 of Saruch, of Ragau, of Phalec, of Heber, of Sala,
\v 36 of Cainan, of Arphaxad, of Sem, of Noe, of Lamech,
\v 37 of Methusaleh, of Enoch, of Jared, of Maleleel, of Cainan,
\v 38 of Enos, of Seth, of Adam, \add the son\add* of God.

\p
\v 1 THEN Jesus full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the spirit into the wilderness,
\v 2 being tempted forty days by the devil; and did eat nothing during those days: and when they were ended, afterwards he was hungry.
\v 3 And the devil said to him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it become a loaf.
\v 4 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.”
\p
\v 5 And the devil taking him up into an exceeding high mountain, displayed before him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time:
\v 6 and the devil said unto him, I will give thee all this authority, and the glory of these; for to me it is delivered, and to whomsoever I will, I give it.
\v 7 If therefore thou wilt worship before me, all shall be thine.
\v 8 And Jesus answering him, said, Get thee behind me, Satan, for it is written, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and to him alone shalt thou pay divine honour.”
\p
\v 9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a wing of the temple, and said to him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thy self down from hence:
\v 10 for it is written, “He shall give his angels a charge over thee, to guard thee safely;
\v 11 and that in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.”
\v 12 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.”
\v 13 And when the devil had closed all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.
\p
\v 14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and a report went out into all the region round about concerning him.
\v 15 And he taught in their synagogues, being universally admired.
\v 16 And he came to Nazareth, where he was brought up; and he went, according to his usual custom, into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and rose up to read.
\v 17 And there was given to him the book of the prophet Isaiah: and unrolling the volume, he found the passage where it is written,
\v 18 “The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for the work whereunto he hath anointed me; he hath sent me to preach glad tidings to the poor; to heal the contrite in heart; to proclaim liberty to the captives; and restore sight to the blind; to send forth the bruised free from bonds;
\v 19 to publish the acceptable year of the Lord.”
\v 20 And rolling up the volume, he gave it to the attendant officer, and sat down. And the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were attentively fixed on him.
\v 21 And he began to say to them, To day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears.
\v 22 And all concurred in their testimony to him, and marvelled at the gracious words which proceeded from his mouth. And they said, Is not this the son of Joseph?
\v 23 And he said unto them, Ye will probably say to me this parable, Physician, heal thyself! the works which we have heard to have been performed by thee at Capernaum, do the like here in thy own country.
\v 24 But he said, Verily, I say unto you, that no prophet is acceptable in his own country.
\v 25 Now I tell you of a certainty, that there were many widows in the days of Elias, in Israel, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, so that a grievous famine was upon all the land.
\v 26 And unto none of them was Elias sent, but unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a widow woman.
\v 27 And many lepers were in Israel in the days of the prophet Elisha, and no one of them was cleansed, but Naaman the Syrian.
\v 28 And they were all filled with rage in the synagogue, when they heard these observations:
\v 29 and rising up, dragged him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill, on which their city was built, in order to cast him down headlong:
\v 30 but he passing through the midst of them, went away.
\p
\v 31 And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the sabbath.
\v 32 And they were struck with astonishment at his teaching; for his discourse was with authority.
\v 33 And there was in the synagogue a man, who had a spirit of an unclean devil, and he roared out with a great cry,
\v 34 saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, Jesus the Nazarean? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.
\v 35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Stop thy mouth, and come out of him. And the devil throwing him down into the midst, came out of him, doing him no injury.
\v 36 And amazement seized on all present, and they spake one to another, saying, What a word is this? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.
\v 37 And the fame of him went forth into all the adjacent region.
\p
\v 38 Then rising up out of the synagogue, he came into the house of Simon: and Simon’s mother-in-law was seized with a violent fever, and they besought him on her behalf.
\v 39 And standing over her, he charged the fever \add to depart\add*; and it left her: and immediately she arose, and waited upon them.
\p
\v 40 So when the sun was set, all who had any indisposed with various diseases, brought them to him; and laying his hands severally on each of them, he cured them.
\v 41 And devils also went out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Messiah the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was the Messiah.
\p
\v 42 And as the day was coming on, he went forth and departed into a desert place: and the multitude sought him out, and came to him, and would have detained him that he should not leave them.
\v 43 But he said unto them, I must preach the glad tidings of the kingdom of heaven in other cities also: for on this service am I sent.
\v 44 And he continued preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
\c 5
\cl CHAP. V.
\p
\v 1 AND it came to pass, as the multitude were thronging upon him, in order to hear the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret:
\v 2 and he saw two vessels a-ground near the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and washing their nets.
\v 3 Then he went on board one of the vessels, which was Simon’s, and desired him to put off a little from the land: and sitting down, he taught the multitudes out of the vessel.
\v 4 And when he ceased speaking, he said to Simon, Go off into deep water, and shoot your nets for a draught.
\v 5 And Simon answering, said unto him, Sir, we have been toiling all night, and have taken nothing: but at thy command I will shoot the net.
\v 6 And having done so, they inclosed a prodigious multitude of fishes; and their net was broken.
\v 7 And they made signals to their partners in the other vessels, that they should come to their assistance. And they came, and filled both the vessels, so that they were ready to founder.
\v 8 Then Simon Peter seeing it, fell down on his knees before Jesus, saying, Go from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord!
\v 9 For amazement had seized on him, and on all who were with him, at the draught of fishes which they had taken:
\v 10 as also on James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not: henceforward thou shalt catch men.
\v 11 And when they had brought their vessels on shore, they left all, and followed him.
\p
\v 12 And it came to pass as he was just at one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy! and seeing Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
\v 13 And he stretching out his hand touched him, saying, I will: be thou cleansed. And instantly the leprosy departed from him.
\v 14 And he commanded him to tell no man: but go shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy purification, as Moses enjoined, for a testimony unto them.
\v 15 Now the discourse concerning him more and more spread through the country: and vast multitudes came together to hear him, and to be cured by him of their disorders.
\v 16 But he himself was in the desert for retirement and prayer.
\p
\v 17 And on a certain day it happened that he was teaching, and there were sitting Pharisees, and doctors of the law, who had come from every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord for healing them was exercised.
\v 18 And behold, men carried on a couch a man who was a paralytic; and sought to bring him into the house, and to place him before him.
\v 19 And not discovering by what means they could introduce him, because of the crowd, they went up to the roof, and through the tiling let him down with his little couch into the midst, before Jesus.
\v 20 And seeing their faith, he saith to him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
\v 21 And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?
\v 22 And Jesus knowing their reasoning, in reply said to them, Why do ye reason in your hearts?
\v 23 for which is the easier? to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise and walk?
\v 24 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority upon earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the paralytic,) I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thy house.
\v 25 And instantly he rose up before them, took up that on which he had lain, and went away to his house, giving glory to God.
\v 26 And an extacy of admiration seized upon them all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with awe, saying, We have seen wondrously strange things to-day.
\p
\v 27 And after these things he went out, and saw a farmer of the taxes, named Levi, sitting at the custom-house: and he said unto him, Follow me.
\v 28 And leaving all behind, he rose, and followed him.
\v 29 And Levi made him a great entertainment at his house and there was a great number of publicans and others, sitting at table with them.
\v 30 And their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
\v 31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They who are well, have no need of a physician: but they who have illness.
\v 32 I came not to call righteous men, but sinners, to repentance.
\p
\v 33 Then said they unto him, Why do the disciples of John observe frequent fasts, and make prayers; but thine are eating and drinking?
\v 34 And he said unto them, Can you make the children of the bridechamber fast, as long as the bridegroom is with them?
\v 35 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then shall they fast in those days.
\v 36 Then he spake a parable unto them, No man putteth a patch of new cloth on an old garment; but if otherwise, both the new makes a rent, and the patch from the new is not of a piece with the old.
\v 37 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; for if he doth, the new wine will burst the bottles, and it will itself be spilled, and the bottles be destroyed.
\v 38 But new wine should be put into new bottles; then both are preserved.
\v 39 And no man drinking old wine, immediately desires new: for he saith, The old is better.

\p
\v 1 AND it came to pass on the sabbath after the second day of the passover, that he was passing through the cornfields; and the disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them out in their hands.
\v 2 Then said some of the Pharisees unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful on the sabbath-day?
\v 3 And Jesus answering said to them; Have ye never read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him?
\v 4 how he entered into the house of God, and took the loaves of shew-bread, and did eat, and gave also to those who were with him; which it was not lawful for any to eat, but the priests alone?
\v 5 And he said, The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath-day.
\p
\v 6 And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and a man was there, and his right hand was shrunk.
\v 7 Then the scribes and Pharisees watched him, if he would heal on the sabbath-day, that they might find an accusation against him.
\v 8 Now he knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise, and stand in the midst. And he arose, and stood up.
\v 9 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you a question; Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath-day, or to do evil? to preserve life or to destroy it?
\v 10 And looking round upon them all, he said to the man, Stretch out thine hand; and he did so: and his hand was restored sound as the other.
\v 11 But they were filled with madness, and talked earnestly to each other what they could do to Jesus.
\p
\v 12 Now it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in an oratory of God.
\v 13 And when it was day, he called his disciples to him; and elected from them twelve, whom he named Apostles:
\v 14 Simon, whom he also called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
\v 15 Matthew and Thomas, James son of Alpheus, and Simon called the Zealous,
\v 16 Jude the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor.
\v 17 And coming down with them, he stood on a level spot: and the crowd of his disciples, and a vast multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
\v 18 and they who were disturbed with unclean spirits: and they were cured.
\v 19 And all the multitude strove to touch him, for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.
\p
\v 20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
\v 21 Blessed are ye who hunger now, for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh.
\v 22 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from them, and shall revile you, and shall cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.
\v 23 Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy; for, lo! your reward is great in heaven: for after the same manner did your fathers to the prophets.
\v 24 But wo unto you who are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
\v 25 Wo unto you who are full! for ye shall hunger. Wo unto you who laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
\v 26 Wo unto you, when men shall speak well of you! for just so did their fathers of the false prophets.
\v 27 But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you;
\v 28 bless those who curse you, and pray for those who wantonly insult you.
\v 29 To him that smiteth thee on the cheek, offer the other also; and from him who would take from thee thy cloak, withhold not thy coat also.
\v 30 And give to every one that asketh thee; and from him who would take thy goods, demand them not again.
\v 31 And as ye would that men should do unto you, do ye also to them in like manner.
\p
\v 32 And if ye love them that love you, what thanks are due to you? for even sinners love those who love them.
\v 33 And if ye do good to them who do good to you, what thanks have ye? do not even sinners the same thing?
\v 34 And if ye lend to those, from whom ye hope to receive back again, what thanks are due to you? for sinners lend to sinners, that they may receive an equivalent.
\v 35 But love your enemies, and do good and lend, hoping for nothing in return: and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Most High; for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the wicked.
\v 36 Be ye therefore compassionate, as also your Father is compassionate.
\v 37 And judge not, that ye be not judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned:
\v 38 give, and there shall be given unto you; good measure pressed down, and shook, and running over, shall they give into your lap. For with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured back to you again.
\p
\v 39 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? will they not both fall into the pit?
\v 40 The disciple is not above his teacher; but every one who is completely taught shall be as his master.
\p
\v 41 But why beholdest thou the mote which is in thy brother’s eye, but observest not the beam which is in thine own eye?
\v 42 Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, permit me to take off the mote which is on thine eye, not seeing thyself the beam in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite! cast out the beam which is in thine eye, and then shalt thou see distinctly to take off the mote which is in thy brother’s eye.
\v 43 For there is no good tree which produceth fruit of a bad quality; neither doth a tree of a bad sort produce good fruit.
\v 44 Every tree is known by its own peculiar fruit. For men do not gather figs from off thorns, nor do they gather from the bramble a bunch of grapes.
\v 45 A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, produceth what is good; and a wicked man, from the evil treasure in his heart, produceth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
\v 46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
\v 47 Every one who cometh to me, and heareth my words, and puts them in practice, I will shew you to whom he is like:
\v 48 he is like to a man, building a house, who digged, and sunk deep, and laid the foundation on a rock; and when there was a flood, the river rushed violently against that house, and was not of force to shake it, for it was founded on a rock.
\v 49 But he that heareth, and doth not practice, is like a man who built his house on the earth without a foundation; against which the river rushed violently, and immediately it fell; and the crash of the fall of that house was great.

\cl CHAP. VII.
\p
\v 1 NOW after he had finished all these sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
\v 2 And the servant of a certain centurion, who was very valuable to him, being seized with an illness, was ready to die.
\v 3 But when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, entreating him that he would come and preserve the life of his servant.
\v 4 And when they came to Jesus, they entreated him importunately, saying, He is a worthy man on whom thou wilt confer this favour:
\v 5 for he loveth our nation, and hath himself built us a synagogue.
\v 6 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion dispatched towards him friends, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not deserving that thou shouldest enter beneath my roof.
\v 7 Therefore neither did I think myself worthy to come unto thee, but speak in a word, and my servant will be cured.
\v 8 For I also am a man under authority, and have under my command soldiers; and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come hither, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
\v 9 Then Jesus, on hearing these things, respected him highly, and turning to the multitude which was following him, he said, I tell you, I have not found such faith, even in Israel.
\v 10 And they who were sent, on their return to the house, found the servant who was sick in perfect health.
\p
\v 11 And it came to pass the next day, that he went into a city called Nain; and a considerable number of his disciples went with him, and a vast multitude.
\v 12 And as he drew near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was carrying out, an only son to his mother, and she a widow; and a great concourse of the city was with her.
\v 13 And when Jesus saw her, he was moved with compassion for her, and said unto her, Weep not.
\v 14 And approaching, he touched the bier: and the bearers stood still; and he said, Young man, I say to thee, Arise.
\v 15 And the dead man sat up, and began to speak: and he delivered him to his mother.
\v 16 And fear fell on all, and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us, and that God hath looked down with mercy on his people.
\v 17 And this account respecting him went abroad through all Judea, and all the region adjacent.
\p
\v 18 And his disciples informed John of all these things.
\v 19 And John calling two certain persons of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or are we to expect another?
\v 20 Then the men came to him, saying, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or are we to expect another?
\v 21 And in that very hour he cured many of diseases and acute complaints, and evil spirits; and to many blind persons he gave sight.
\v 22 And Jesus addressing them, said, Go, tell John what things ye have seen and heard: that the blind recover sight, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached unto them.
\v 23 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended at me.
\p
\v 24 Now when John’s messengers were departed, he began to speak to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
\v 25 But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in delicate garments? Behold, they who indulge in soft raiment, and delicate food, are in king’s palaces.
\v 26 But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.
\v 27 For this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
\v 28 For I tell you, of those born from woman, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he.
\v 29 And all the people when they heard it, and the publicans, glorified God, being baptised with the baptism of John.
\v 30 But the Pharisees and teachers of the law rejected the counsel of God towards themselves, not being baptised by him.
\p
\v 31 And the Lord said, To what then shall I compare the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
\v 32 They are like to children sitting in the markets, and calling to each other, and saying, We have played the flute to you, and ye have not danced; we have raised the cry of mourning, and ye have not wept.
\v 33 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.
\v 34 The Son of man is come eating and drinking, and ye say, A gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
\v 35 though wisdom hath been justified by her children.
\p
\v 36 Then one of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to table.
\v 37 And, behold, a certain woman in the city, who was a notorious offender, when she knew that Jesus was sitting at table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster vessel of odoriferous balm,
\v 38 and standing at his feet behind him, began to water his feet with her tears, and to wipe them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the perfumed balm.
\v 39 And when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said within himself, If this man were a prophet, he would know who and what kind of a woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a notorious sinner.
\v 40 And Jesus addressing himself to him said, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he said, Master, speak freely.
\p
\v 41 A certain creditor had two debtors, the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
\v 42 But having nothing to pay, he forgave them both. Tell me, which of these, then, will love him most?
\v 43 And Simon answering said, I suppose, he to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast judged rightly.
\v 44 So turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Thou seest this woman? I came into thine house, even water for my feet thou gavest not; but she hath washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.
\v 45 One kiss hast thou not given me, but she from the time she hath come in, hath not ceased tenderly to kiss my feet.
\v 46 My head with oil thou hast not anointed; but she hath anointed my feet with odoriferous balm.
\v 47 For which cause, I tell thee, her many sins are forgiven, for she hath loved much: but to whom a little is forgiven, he loveth little.
\v 48 And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven.
\v 49 And they who sat at table with him began to say in themselves, Who is this, who even forgives sins?
\v 50 But he said unto the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

\cl CHAP. VIII.
\p
\v 1 AND it came to pass afterwards, that he went through every city and village, preaching and publishing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God, and the twelve with him.
\v 2 And certain women who had been cured of evil spirits and sicknesses, Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven devils had gone out.
\v 3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s lieutenant-governor, and Susanna, and many others, who ministred to his support out of their possessions.
\p
\v 4 Now when a vast multitude was collected, even those who came to him out of every city, he spake by a parable.
\v 5 A sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell by the road side, and was trodden under foot, and the birds of the air devoured it up.
\v 6 And other seed fell on a rock, and vegetating, withered because it had no moisture.
\v 7 And other seed fell amidst thorns, and the thorns springing up with it, choked it.
\v 8 And some fell on good ground, and shooting up, produced fruit an hundred fold. So saying, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\p
\v 9 Then his disciples asked him, saying. What might this parable mean?
\v 10 And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to the rest in parables: that seeing they may not perceive, and hearing may not comprehend.
\v 11 Now this is the parable: The seed is the word of God.
\v 12 They by the road side, are such as hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh the word from their heart, that they should not be saved in believing.
\v 13 And they on the rock, are such as when they have heard, with joy embrace the word; and these have not root, who for a time believe, and in a season of trial apostasize.
\v 14 And that which fell among thorns, are they having heard, and going away, are choked by the cares, and wealth, and pleasures of life, and bring forth no perfect fruit.
\v 15 But that on the good ground are they who having heard the word, retain it in a heart excellent and good, and bring forth fruit with patience.
\p
\v 16 No man lighting a lamp hides it with a cover, or putteth it under a bed, but on a stand, that they who are coming in, may see the light.
\v 17 For there is nothing hid which shall not be made manifest, nor concealed, which shall not be known and brought to light.
\v 18 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, even what he seemeth to have shall be taken away from.
\p
\v 19 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come near him because of the crowd.
\v 20 And it was told him, saying, Thy mother and thy brethren are standing without, desirous of seeing thee.
\v 21 Then he answered and said to them, My mother and my brethren are they, who hear the word of God, and practise it.
\p
\v 22 And it came to pass on one of the days, that he went himself into a ship, and his disciples, and said unto them, Let us pass over to the farther side of the lake. And they set fail.
\v 23 And while they were on the passage, he went to sleep: and a hurricane of wind rushed down on the lake; and they were filled with water, and imminent danger.
\v 24 Then they came and awoke him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing. Then arising, he issued his command to the wind, and the billows of water, and they subsided, and there was a calm.
\v 25 And he said to them, Where is your faith? And they feared and were astonished, saying one to another, Well! what a man is this! that he commands even the winds and the sea, and they obey him.
\p
\v 26 And they sailed over unto the region of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
\v 27 And as he landed, there met him a certain man from the city, who had devils for a long while, and kept no clothes on him, and never abode in a house, but in the tombs.
\v 28 But when he saw Jesus, roaring out, he fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God Most High? I pray thee, torment me not.
\v 29 For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man; for many times it had seized on him; and though under a guard, and bound with chains and fetters; yet bursting the bonds, he was driven by the devil into the desert places.
\v 30 Then Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? and he said, Legion: for many devils were entered into him.
\v 31 And he besought him that he would not order them to go into the abyss.
\v 32 Now a herd of many swine was there feeding on the mountain; and they besought him that he would permit them to enter into them. And he permitted them.
\v 33 Then the devils going out of the man, entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down a precipice into the lake, and was suffocated.
\v 34 But when those who fed them saw what was done they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country places.
\v 35 And they came out to see what had happened; and they came to Jesus, and found the man sitting, from whom the devils were gone out, clothed, and in his sound mind, at the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid.
\v 36 Then they also who had seen how the demoniac was recovered, told them.
\v 37 And the whole multitude of the country around the Gadarenes, entreated him to depart from them; for they were seized with great terror: and he embarked on the vessel, and returned.
\v 38 And the man out of whom the devils had gone, besought him to be with him; but Jesus sent him away, saying,
\v 39 Return to thy house, and declare what things God hath done for thee. And he went away, and published through the whole city what things Jesus had done for him.
\p
\v 40 And it came to pass, when Jesus returned, the people welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
\v 41 And, behold, there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and falling at the feet of Jesus, he entreated him to come to his house;
\v 42 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying: and as he was going, the multitude thronged him.
\v 43 And a woman, who had a flux of blood, for twelve years, who had spent all her substance on physicians, and could not get a cure from any;
\v 44 coming behind him, touched the fringe of his garment; and instantly the flux of her blood stopped.
\v 45 And Jesus said, Who touched me? And when all denied, Peter, and those who were with him, said, Master, the multitudes throng and press thee, and sayest thou, Who hath touched me?
\v 46 Then said Jesus, Some person hath touched me, for I know that miraculous power is gone out from me.
\v 47 Then the woman seeing she was not hid, came trembling, and falling down before him, declared to him before all the people, for what cause she had touched him; and how she was cured instantaneously.
\v 48 Then he said unto her, Be of good cheer, daughter, thy faith hath made thee well; go in peace.
\p
\v 49 And while he was yet speaking, a person came to the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead, give the master no further trouble.
\v 50 Then Jesus hearing it, addressed him, saying, Fear not, only believe, and she shall be saved.
\v 51 And entering into the house, he suffered no person to come in, but Peter, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the child.
\v 52 Now all were weeping and lamenting her: and he said, Weep not, she is not dead, but asleep.
\v 53 And they derided him, for they knew that she was dead.
\v 54 And he put them all without, and taking her by the hand, cried, saying, Maid, arise!
\v 55 And her spirit returned, and she immediately arose; and he commanded to give her something to eat.
\v 56 And her parents were struck with amazement. But he enjoined them to tell no man what was done.

\cl CHAP. IX.
\p
\v 1 THEN calling his twelve disciples, he gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.
\v 2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
\v 3 And he said to them, Take nothing for the journey, neither staffs, nor satchel, nor bread, nor money, nor have two coats each.
\v 4 And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence go out.
\v 5 And whosoever shall not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the dust from your feet, for a testimony against them.
\v 6 And they went forth, and passed through the villages, preaching the gospel, and performing cures everywhere.
\p
\v 7 Then Herod the tetrarch heard of all things that were done by him; and he was in much distraction of mind, because it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead:
\v 8 and of some that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the ancient prophets was risen again.
\v 9 And Herod said, John I beheaded; but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.
\p
\v 10 And when the apostles returned, they told him what they had done. And taking them, he withdrew privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
\v 11 But when the multitudes knew it, they followed him and receiving them, he spake to them concerning the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of a cure.
\v 12 Now the day began to decline: and the twelve coming to him, said, Dismiss the multitude, that going away into the villages and farms round about, they may lodge and find provision; for here we are in a desert place.
\v 13 Then he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves, and two fishes; unless we go somewhere and buy provisions for all this multitude:
\v 14 for there were about five thousand men. Then said he to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties each in companies.
\v 15 And they did so: and they made them all sit down.
\v 16 And taking the five loaves, and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
\v 17 And they did all eat, and were filled; and there were taken up of the fragments which were more than enough for them, twelve baskets.
\p
\v 18 And it came to pass, as he had been praying in retirement, his disciples were with him, and he asked them, Who do the multitudes say that I am?
\v 19 And they answering said, John the Baptist; but some Elias; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.
\v 20 And he said to them, But who do ye say that I am? Then Peter answering said, The Messiah of God.
\v 21 And strictly charging them, he commanded, that they should tell no man this:
\v 22 saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and be put to death, and on the third day rise again.
\p
\v 23 And he said unto them, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
\v 24 For whosoever would preserve his life shall lose it; but whosoever would lose his life for my sake, shall preserve it.
\v 25 For what advantage hath a man in gaining all the would, if he destroy himself, or be punished with the loss of life?
\v 26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and his father’s, and of the holy angels.
\v 27 And I tell you of a certainty, there are some of those who stand here, who shall not taste death, till they see the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 28 And it was about eight days after these discourses, that taking Peter, and John, and James, he went up into a mountain to pray.
\v 29 And it came to pass, as he was at prayer, that the appearance of his countenance was altered, and his raiment white and refulgent.
\v 30 And, lo! two men conversed with him, who were Moses and Elias:
\v 31 who appeared in glory, and mentioned his departure, which he was ready to accomplish at Jerusalem.
\v 32 But Peter and they who were with him were weighed down with sleep: but when they awoke, they beheld his glory, and the two men who were standing with them.
\v 33 And it came to pass, as they were departing from him, Peter said unto Jesus, it is well that we are here, and we will make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias; not knowing what he said.
\v 34 And as he was thus speaking, a cloud came and overshadowed them: and they were afraid as they were entering into the cloud.
\v 35 And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son; hear him.
\v 36 And when the voice ceased, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days a word of the things which they had seen.
\p
\v 37 And it came to pass, on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.
\v 38 And, behold, a man from among the multitude cried out aloud, saying, Master, I pray thee, look upon my son; for he is my only begotten.
\v 39 And, behold! a spirit taketh him, and suddenly he crieth out, and convulseth him, with foaming; and bruising him, with difficulty retires from him.
\v 40 And I besought thy disciples that they would cast him out, and they could not.
\v 41 Then Jesus answering, said, O faithless and perverse generation! how long shall I be with you, how long shall I bear with you? bring hither thy son.
\v 42 And while he was yet approaching the devil threw him down, and violently convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and cured the child; and restored him to his father.
\v 43 And they were all struck with amazement at the mighty power of God. And while they were all wondering at the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
\v 44 Keep ye these sayings in your ears; for the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men.
\v 45 And they understood not that declaration, and it was hid from them, that they should not comprehend its meaning: and they were afraid to ask him concerning that saying.
\p
\v 46 Then a dispute sprang up among them, which of them should be the greatest.
\v 47 But Jesus knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a little boy, and set him by his side,
\v 48 and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name, receiveth me; and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me: for he who is the least among you all, he shall be great.
\p
\v 49 Then John addressing him said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and we forbad him, because he followed not with us.
\v 50 And Jesus said to him, Forbid him not; for he that is not against us, is for us.
\p
\v 51 And it came to pass, as the days hastened to their period when he should be received up \add to glory\add*, that he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem;
\v 52 and sent messengers before his face; and they advancing entered into a Samaritan village, to make preparation for him.
\v 53 And they would not admit him, because his face was directed to Jerusalem.
\v 54 And when the disciples James and John saw it, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them, just as Elias did?
\v 55 And turning to them, he reproved them, and said, Ye know not what spirit ye are of:
\v 56 for the Son of man came not to destroy men’s lives, but to preserve them. And he proceeded to another village.
\v 57 And it came to pass, as they were walking on the road, a certain person said to him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
\v 58 And Jesus Said to him, The foxes have holts, and the birds of the air, nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
\p
\v 59 And he said to another, Follow me. And he said, Lord, permit me first to return home, and put my father in his grave.
\v 60 And Jesus said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but go thou, preach the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 61 Then said another, I will follow thee, Lord, but give me leave first to bid adieu to those at my house.
\v 62 But Jesus said unto him, No man laying his hand on the plough, and looking to the things left behind, is fit for the kingdom of God.

\cl CHAP. X.
\p
\v 1 THEN after these things the Lord appointed other seventy persons also, and sent them, two and two before his face, into every city and place, whither he himself designed to go.
\v 2 He said therefore unto them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the labourers few: pray ye therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he would send out labourers into his harvest.
\v 3 Go forth! behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.
\v 4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor sandals: and stay to salute no man on the road.
\v 5 And into whatever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.
\v 6 And if the Son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return back to you again.
\v 7 And in the same family abide, eating and drinking such as they have: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not about from house to house.
\v 8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they welcome you, eat whatever is set before you:
\v 9 and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
\v 10 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets of it, and say,
\v 11 Even the dust of your city, which sticks to us, we shake off against you: nevertheless this know, that the kingdom of God is come near to you.
\v 12 Now I tell you, that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in that day, than for that city.
\v 13 Wo to thee Chorazin! wo to thee Bethsaida! for if the miracles which have been done in thee, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes, would they have repented.
\v 14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
\v 15 And thou Capernaum, which hast been lifted up to heaven, shalt be cast down to hell.
\v 16 He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth Him that sent me.
\p
\v 17 Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through thy name.
\v 18 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan falling as lightning from heaven.
\v 19 Behold, I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shalt in any wise hurt you.
\v 20 Nevertheless, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are made subject to you; but rejoice rather, that your names are inscribed in the heavens.
\p
\v 21 In the same hour Jesus exulted in spirit, and said, I ascribe glory to thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and hast revealed them to babes: be it so, O Father! since such is thy good pleasure.
\v 22 All things are given up to me by my Father: and no man knoweth who is the Son, but the Father; and who is the Father, but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son is pleased to reveal him.
\v 23 Then turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things which ye see:
\v 24 for I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard them.
\p
\v 25 And, behold, a certain doctor of the law arose, to make trial of him, saying, Master, by doing what shall I inherit eternal life?
\v 26 And he said unto him, What is written in the law? How readest thou?
\v 27 And he answering said, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might, and with all thy understanding, and thy neighbour as thyself.”
\v 28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered rightly: this do, and thou shalt live.
\v 29 Then he, desirous to make himself appear a righteous person, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?
\v 30 Then Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who, when they had both stripped him, and covered him with wounds, got off, leaving him half dead.
\v 31 And it so fell out, that a certain priest went down that way, and seeing him, he kept the opposite side of the road.
\v 32 And a Levite also, in the same way, being near the place, came, and seeing him, kept the opposite side of the road.
\v 33 But a certain Samaritan travelling, came by him, and seeing him, was moved with compassion,
\v 34 and coming up to him, bound up his wounds, after pouring on them oil and wine; then setting him on his own beast, he led him to an inn, and took particular care of him.
\v 35 And on the morrow, as he was departing, he took out of his purse two denarii, and gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, Take great care of him; and whatever farther expence may be incurred, when I return, I will repay thee.
\v 36 Which then of these three do you suppose to be the neighbour of him who fell into the robbers’ hands?
\v 37 And he said, He that shewed mercy towards him. Then said Jesus to him, Go, and do thou exactly the same.
\p
\v 38 And it came to pass, as they were travelling, that he entered into a certain village; and a woman, named Martha, received him into her house.
\v 39 And she had a sister called Mary, who sitting down also at the feet of Jesus, hearkened to his discourse.
\v 40 But Martha was hurrying about to provide a large entertainment, and coming up to him, she said, Lord, is it no concern to thee, that my sister hath left me to make the whole provision by myself? bid her therefore to assist me.
\v 41 But Jesus answering said to her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and disturbing thyself about many things.
\v 42 But of one thing there is need: and Mary hath made her election of that good portion, which shall not be taken away from her.
\c 11
\cl CHAP. XI.
\p
\v 1 AND it came to pass, as he was in a certain place praying, when he had done, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.
\v 2 And he said unto them, When ye pray say, Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name: thy kingdom come: thy will be done as in heaven so upon earth.
\v 3 Give us our necessary food, day by day:
\v 4 and forgive us our sins, for we also forgive every one who is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation; but deliver us from the wicked one.
\p
\v 5 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and he shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
\v 6 for a friend of mine is come to me off a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.
\v 7 And he from within answering, shall say, Give me no farther trouble: my door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed; I am unable to rise and give thee.
\v 8 I tell you, though even he would not rise and give him because he is his friend; yet because of his importunity, roused up, he will give him as many as he needeth.
\v 9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
\v 10 For every one who asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
\v 11 For what father of you, if his son ask a loaf, will he give him a stone? or if a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
\v 12 or if he ask also an egg, will he give him a scorpion?
\v 13 If ye then, evil as ye are, know how to give good gifts to your children; how much more shall your Father, who is in heaven, give his Holy Spirit to those who ask him?
\p
\v 14 And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb person spake, and the people marvelled.
\v 15 But some of them said, He casteth out devils by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.
\v 16 But others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
\v 17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and a house against a house, falleth.
\v 18 And if Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom be established? because ye say, that I cast out devils by Beelzebub.
\v 19 But if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.
\v 20 But if with the finger of God I cast out devils, then, verily the kingdom of God is come unto you.
\v 21 When a strong man, in complete armour, guards his palace, his goods are in peace.
\v 22 But when a stronger person than he coming, vanquisheth him, he takes away his suit of armour in which he confided, and distributes the spoils.
\v 23 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth abroad.
\p
\v 24 When the unclean spirit goeth out of a man, he passes through places destitute of water, seeking repose; and not finding it, saith, I will go back to my habitation from whence I came out:
\v 25 and coming, he findeth it swept and furnished.
\v 26 Then goeth he, and taketh seven other spirits, more wicked than himself; and they entering in, take up their abode there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.
\p
\v 27 And it came to pass as he was speaking these words, a certain woman from among the multitude lift up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou hast sucked.
\v 28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God and observe it.
\p
\v 29 Then the multitudes thronging around him, he began to say, This is a wicked generation: it seeketh a sign, and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
\v 30 For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall the Son of man also be to this generation.
\v 31 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment against the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
\v 32 The men of Nineveh shall rise up in judgment against this generation, and shall condemn it, for they repented on the preaching of Jonah, and, behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
\p
\v 33 But no man lighting a lamp putteth it in a concealed place, or under a bushel, but on a stand, that they who are coming in, may see the light.
\v 34 The lamp of the body is the eye: when therefore thine eye is clear, thy whole body will be luminous, but if it be vitiated, thy whole body will be darkened.
\v 35 Let it be thy aim then, that the light which is in thee do not become darkness.
\v 36 If then thy whole body be illuminated, not having any dark part, it will be wholly luminous, as a lamp by its brightness diffuseth light.
\p
\v 37 Now as he was speaking, a certain Pharisee invited him to dine with him; and going in with him, he sat down.
\v 38 But the Pharisee seeing it, marvelled, that he had not washed before dinner.
\v 39 Then said the Lord unto him, Now ye Pharisees make the outside of the cup and of the dish clean, but your inward parts are full of extortion and wickedness.
\v 40 Ye senseless men! did not he who made that which is without, make also that which is within?
\v 41 But give what is within them for alms; and, lo! all will be pure unto you.
\v 42 But wo to you, Pharisees, because ye tithe mint, and rue, and every herb, and pass by judgment and the love of God. These ought ye to have done, and not to have omitted the other.
\v 43 Wo unto you, Pharisees, for ye love the first seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the places of public concourse.
\v 44 Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves concealed, which men, while walking over them, see not.
\p
\v 45 Then one of the doctors of the law addressing him, said, Master, thus speaking, thou reproachest us also.
\v 46 And he said, Wo also to you, teachers of the law! for ye load men with burdens hardly bearable, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
\v 47 Wo unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
\v 48 Ye do indeed bear witness to, and with pleasure concur in your fathers’ deeds; for they truly killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.
\v 49 Therefore also the wisdom of God hath said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall kill, and shall persecute:
\v 50 that the blood of all the prophets, which hath been shed since the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation:
\v 51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who was slain between the altar and the temple: verily I tell you, It shall be required of this generation.
\v 52 Wo unto you, teachers of the law! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge; ye yourselves enter not in, and those who were entering ye have hindered.
\p
\v 53 And as he was saying these things unto them, the scribes and Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to extort answers from him respecting many things;
\v 54 laying snares for him, and seeking to catch hold of something from his mouth, that they might accuse him.
\c 12
\cl CHAP. XII.
\p
\v 1 MEANTIME myriads of people collecting, so that they trod on one another, he began to speak to his disciples, Take heed principally of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
\v 2 For there is nothing concealed, that shall not be laid open; nor hid, which shall not be known.
\v 3 Wherefore whatsoever things ye have spoken in darkness, they shall be reported in the light; and what ye have whispered into the ear in the closets, shall be proclaimed on the house-tops.
\v 4 But I say to you my friends, Be not afraid of those who may kill the body, but after that, have nothing farther which they can do.
\v 5 But I will point out to you, whom ye should fear: Fear him, who, after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him!
\v 6 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, yet not one of them is forgotten before God?
\v 7 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered: fear not then, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
\v 8 But I tell you, Every one who shall confess me before men, him will the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:
\v 9 but he that disowns me before men, shall be disowned before the angels of God.
\v 10 And every one who shall utter a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but for him who hath blasphemed against the Holy Ghost, there shall be no forgiveness.
\p
\v 11 And when they shall bring you before the synagogues, and magistrates, and the ruling powers, be under no anxiety how or what defence ye shall make, or what ye shall say:
\v 12 for the Holy Ghost will teach you at that very hour what ye ought to say.
\p
\v 13 Then spake one of the multitude to him, Master, order my brother to divide the inheritance with me.
\v 14 But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge and a divider among you?
\v 15 Then said he to them, Beware, and be on your guard against covetousness; for a man’s life doth not depend on the abundance of his possessions.
\v 16 And he spake a parable unto them, saying,
\p The estate of a certain rich man bore plentifully:
\v 17 and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do? for I have not room where I may house my crops.
\v 18 And he said, I will do this; I will take down my barns, and build them larger, and collect there all my crops, and my good things!
\v 19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast a multitude of good things in store for many years, be at ease, eat, drink, and be merry!
\v 20 But God said to him, Thou fool! this night shall they demand thy life from thee; and the things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be?
\v 21 Just such is every one who heapeth up treasure for self, and is not rich towards God.
\p
\v 22 Then said he to his disciples, For this reason I tell you, Be under no anxiety about your life, what ye shall eat, nor for your body, how ye shall be clothed.
\v 23 The life is more than food, and the body than raiment.
\v 24 Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap; they have neither storehouse nor barn; yet God feedeth them: how much are ye more excellent than the birds?
\v 25 Which of you, with all his anxiety, can add one moment to his life?
\v 26 If therefore ye are unable to do the least thing, why are ye anxious about the others?
\v 27 Observe the lillies how they grow up, they toil not, nor spin; but I tell you, that Solomon in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these.
\v 28 If God then so clothe the grass in the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is thrown into the furnace; how much more you, O ye of little faith?
\v 29 So then be not ye inquisitive what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor be agitated with restless anxiety.
\v 30 For after all these things are the nations of the world seeking; and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
\v 31 But seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be given you over.
\p
\v 32 Fear not, little flock! for your Father takes delight in giving you the kingdom.
\v 33 Sell all your possessions, and give in charity; make yourselves purses that wax not old, a treasure never failing in the heavens, where no thief approaches, nor doth the moth destroy.
\v 34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
\p
\v 35 Let your loins be firmly girded round, and your lamps burning:
\v 36 and ye like men, expecting their master, when he shall return from the marriage; that when he comes and knocks, they may instantly open the door for him.
\v 37 Blessed are those servants, whom the Master, when he cometh, shall find watchful: verily I say unto you, that he will gird up himself, and make them sit down at table, and come and wait upon them.
\v 38 And if he come in the second watch, or in the third watch, and find them so watchful, blessed are those servants.
\v 39 Now this be assured of, that if the master of the family had known at what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through.
\v 40 Therefore be ye also ready, for at an hour that ye think not of, the Son of man cometh.
\p
\v 41 Then said Peter unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable to us, or also for all?
\v 42 And the Lord said, Who indeed is a faithful steward, and prudent, whom the lord will place over his household, to give them their proportion of provision at the proper season?
\v 43 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so employed.
\v 44 Verily I say unto you, that he will place him over all his property.
\v 45 But if that servant say in his heart, My master will be a long while ere he comes; and shall begin to beat the men and maid-servants, and to eat and to drink, and to get drunk;
\v 46 the master of that servant will come in a day when he doth not expect him, and at an hour which he knoweth not, and shall cut him asunder, and give him his portion with the unfaithful.
\v 47 And that servant, who knew his master’s will, and made no preparation for him, nor did according to his pleasure, shall be beaten with many stripes.
\v 48 But he that knew it not, yet did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For of every one to whom much is given, much shall be required from him: and to whom men commit much, they will of him demand abundantly more.
\p
\v 49 I am come to cast fire on the earth, and what is my wish? that it may be now kindled.
\v 50 But I have a baptism to be baptised with; and how am I distressed in spirit till it is finished!
\v 51 Think ye that I came to bring peace upon earth? No, I tell you; but rather division:
\v 52 for henceforth five shall be in one house, divided, three against two, and two against three.
\v 53 The father shall take part against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the step-mother against her daughter-in-law, and the son’s wife against her mother-in-law.
\p
\v 54 Then said he to the multitudes, When ye see a cloud rising from the west, ye say immediately, There cometh a shower; and it is so.
\v 55 And when the south wind gently blows, ye say, It will be sultry hot; and so it is.
\v 56 Ye hypocrites! ye know how to discern by experience from the appearance of the earth and of the sky; but how is it that ye do not discern this particular time?
\v 57 And why even of yourselves do ye not decide what is just?
\v 58 For as thou art going with thy prosecutor to the magistrate, on the way endeavour to make up the matter with him; lest he drag thee before the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.
\v 59 I tell thee, thou mayest in no wise come out from thence, until thou hast paid the very last mite.

\cl CHAP. XIII.
\p
\v 1 NOW there were some present at that time who informed him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
\v 2 And Jesus in reply said to them, Think ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things?
\v 3 I tell you, No: for except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
\v 4 Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that they were debtors to divine justice above all the men who dwell at Jerusalem?
\v 5 I tell you, No: but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
\p
\v 6 Then he spake this parable: A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and he came, expecting fruit on it, and found none.
\v 7 Then said he to the vine-dresser, Lo! for three years have I come, expecting fruit on this fig-tree, and find none: cut it down; why doth it render the ground thus useless?
\v 8 He answering said to him, Sir, let it e’en remain this year, until that I dig around it, and spread some manure:
\v 9 perhaps it may then produce fruit: but if it does not, afterwards thou shalt cut it down.
\p
\v 10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues, on the sabbath.
\v 11 And, behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and unable to raise herself at all up.
\v 12 But when Jesus saw her, he called out aloud, and said to her, Woman, thou art delivered from thine infirmity.
\v 13 And he laid his hands upon her: and instantly she became erect, and glorified God.
\v 14 Then the ruler of the synagogue, indignant, that on the sabbath Jesus had performed the cure, addressing himself to the multitude, said, There are six days in which work is to be done: on these therefore come and be cured, and not on the sabbath-day.
\v 15 Then the Lord answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not every one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the manger, and lead him to water?
\v 16 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath-day?
\v 17 And when he had made this speech, all his opposers were covered with shame: and all the multitude rejoiced in all the glorious things which were done by him.
\v 18 Then said he, To what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I compare it?
\v 19 It is like a grain of mustard, which a man took and put into his garden; and it grew, and became a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged on its branches.
\p
\v 20 And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?
\v 21 It is like leaven, which a woman taking, covered up in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
\p
\v 22 And he passed through the cities and villages, teaching, and making his way towards Jerusalem.
\v 23 And a person said to him, Lord, are the saved few? And he said unto them,
\v 24 Exert all your powers to enter through the strait gate: for many, I tell you, will seek to enter, but will not be able.
\v 25 When the master of the family shall have arisen, and shut the door, and ye shall begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Master, master, open it for us! and he answering will tell you, I know you not whence ye are:
\v 26 then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.
\v 27 And he will say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.
\v 28 There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom, and yourselves cast out.
\v 29 And they shall come from the east, and west, and from north, and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.
\v 30 And, behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.
\p
\v 31 The same day came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Depart, and begone from hence: for Herod will kill thee.
\v 32 And he said to them, Go tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures today and to-morrow, and on the third day I shall be perfected.
\v 33 But I must go on to-day and to-morrow, and the day following: for it is impossible that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 34 O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! thou that killest the prophets, and stonest those who are sent unto thee; how often would I have collected thy children unto me, just as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings, and ye would not!
\v 35 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: verily I say unto you, That ye shall see me no more, till the day come when ye shall say, Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord.
\c 14

\p
\v 1 AND it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the principal Pharisees, to eat bread on the sabbath, that they were watchfully observant of him.
\v 2 And, behold, there was a certain man who had a dropsy, before him.
\v 3 And Jesus addressing himself to the teachers of the law and the Pharisees, spake, saying, Is it lawful to perform cures on the sabbath?
\v 4 And they said nothing. And he took him, and healed him, and sent him away;
\v 5 and addressing them, said, Whose ass or ox is fallen into a pit, and doth he not immediately pull him out on the sabbath-day?
\v 6 And they were unable to answer him in opposition to these things.
\p
\v 7 Then he spake to those who were invited, a parable, when he observed how they chose the principal seats; saying unto them,
\v 8 When thou art invited of any person to a marriage entertainment, recline not on the principal couch; lest a more honourable personage than thyself be invited by him;
\v 9 and he that invited thee and him, coming say to thee, Yield this person the place; and so thou shalt begin with shame to go down to the lowest place.
\v 10 But when thou art invited, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he who invited thee comes, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher; then shalt thou have respect in the presence of those who are seated with thee.
\v 11 For every one who exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
\p
\v 12 Then said he also to the person who had invited him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, invite not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy relations, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also invite thee again, and a recompence be made to thee.
\v 13 But when thou makest an entertainment, invite the poor, the maimed, the halt, the blind:
\v 14 and thou shalt be blessed; because they cannot recompense thee: for a recompence shall be made thee at the resurrection of the just.
\p
\v 15 Then one of those who sat at table hearing these things, said to him, Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
\v 16 And he said unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and invited many:
\v 17 and sent his servants at supper-time to say to the invited, Come; for all things are now ready.
\v 18 And they all began with one voice to frame excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I must of necessity go and survey it: I pray thee hold me excused.
\v 19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and am going to make a trial of them: I pray thee accept my excuse.
\v 20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
\v 21 And that servant returning, informed his master of these things. Then the master of the family, being highly incensed, said to his servant, Go out instantly into the streets and alleys of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.
\v 22 And the servant said, Sir, it is done as thou orderedst, and yet there is room.
\v 23 And the master said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and urge them to come in, that my house may be filled.
\v 24 For I say unto you, That not one man of those who were invited shall taste of my supper.
\p
\v 25 And great multitudes followed him about: and he turned, and spoke to them,
\v 26 If any man cometh after me, and hateth not father, and mother, and wife and children, and brothers, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
\v 27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, he cannot be my disciple.
\v 28 For what man of you designing to erect a tower, doth not first sitting down calculate the expence, if he have sufficient to complete the work?
\v 29 lest haply, after having laid the foundation, and being unable to finish it, all who look upon it begin to ridicule him,
\v 30 saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
\v 31 Or what king, going forth to encounter another king in battle, doth not sit down first, and consult if he is able with ten thousand men to meet him who is coming against him with twenty thousand?
\v 32 and if he be not, whilst he is still at a distance, he sendeth an embassy, and desires terms of peace.
\v 33 So then, every one of you who will not part with all his possessions, cannot be my disciple.
\p
\v 34 Salt is good: but if the salt become insipid, by what shall it be seasoned?
\v 35 It is neither fit for the land, nor for manure; but they cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

\p
\v 1 THEN drew nigh unto him all the tax-farmers and the sinners to hear him.
\v 2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man entertains sinners, and eateth with them.
\v 3 Then spake he unto them this parable, saying,
\v 4 What man is there of you, possessing an hundred sheep, though he lose but one of them, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?
\v 5 and when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
\v 6 And coming home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Congratulate me; for I have found that sheep of mine which was lost.
\v 7 I tell you, that just so will there be joy in heaven over one repentant sinner, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons, who hold not their need of repentance.
\v 8 Or what woman having ten pieces of silver coin, if she lose one of them, doth she not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and make diligent search until she find it?
\v 9 And having found it, she calleth her female friends and neighbours together, saying, Congratulate me; for I have found the silver piece I had lost.
\v 10 Even so, I tell you, there is joy among the angels of God, over one repentant sinner.
\p
\v 11 Then he said, A certain man had two sons:
\v 12 and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of substance which falls to my share. And he divided with them his fortune.
\v 13 And not many days after, the younger son, collecting his all, travelled into a far distant country, and there dissipated his substance in a life of debauchery.
\v 14 But when he had spent all, there came a terrible famine in that region; and he began to know want.
\v 15 And he went and connected himself with one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
\v 16 And he eagerly longed to fill his belly with the charob berries which the swine did eat: and no person gave him \add a morsel\add*.
\v 17 Then coming to himself, he said, How many hirelings of my father abound with loaves of bread, and I am pining away with famine!
\v 18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
\v 19 and I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hirelings.
\v 20 And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet at a considerable distance, his father discovered him, and was moved with compassion, and running, fell on his neck, and kissed him again and again.
\v 21 Then said the son unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.
\v 22 But the father said to his servants, Bring out the best robe, and clothe him; and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet:
\v 23 and bring hither the stall-fed steer, and kill it; and let us eat, and be joyous.
\v 24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. And they began to be joyous.
\v 25 Now his elder brother had been in the field: and when coming home he drew near the house, he heard a concert of music, and the chorus.
\v 26 And calling one of the servants, he inquired what these things meant.
\v 27 And he said, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed for him the stall-fed steer, because he hath received him in health.
\v 28 Then he was in great wrath, and would not enter the doors: therefore his father came out, and entreated him.
\v 29 But he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years I am serving thee, and never have transgressed thy command: yet to me thou hast never once given a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
\v 30 but no sooner is this son of thine come, who hath devoured thy substance with whores, than thou hast killed for him the stall-fed steer.
\v 31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all my possessions are thine.
\v 32 But it was right that we should rejoice, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.
\c 16
\cl CHAP. XVI.
\p
\v 1 THEN said he also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and he received an information against him, as having dissipated his treasures.
\v 2 And calling him, he said to him, What is this report I hear of thee? give up the account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer in that office.
\v 3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? because my master is taking away the stewardship from me: to dig, I have not the strength; to beg, I am ashamed.
\v 4 I know what I will do, that, when I am removed from the stewardship, they may entertain me at their houses.
\v 5 So calling upon every one of his master’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou to my master?
\v 6 And he said, A hundred baths of oil. And he said, Take thy account, and sit down directly, and write fifty.
\v 7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred core of wheat. And he saith to him, Take thy account, and write fourscore.
\v 8 And the master praised the unjust steward, because he had acted providently: for the children of this world are more provident among their own generation of men, than the children of light.
\v 9 And I say unto you, Make yourselves friends with the unrighteous mammon that when ye fail, they may receive you into the eternal mansions.
\p
\v 10 He that is faithful in the least thing, is faithful also in much: and he who is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much.
\v 11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust you with the true?
\v 12 and if ye have not been faithful in that which belongs to another, who will give up to you that which is your own?
\v 13 No domestic can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will cleave to the one, and neglect the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
\p
\v 14 Then the Pharisees also, who were dear lovers of money, heard all these things, and they sneered at him.
\v 15 And he said unto them, Ye are they who affect to be righteous persons before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men, is an abomination in the sight of God.
\v 16 The law and the prophets were until John: since that the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.
\v 17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fail.
\v 18 Every one who putteth away his wife and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and every one who marrieth a woman divorced from her husband, committeth adultery.
\p
\v 19 Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, making splendid entertainments every day:
\v 20 and there was a certain pauper, named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate covered with ulcers,
\v 21 and importunately desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: yea even the dogs came and licked his ulcers.
\v 22 Now it came to pass that the poor man died, and was carried up by angels into the bosom of Abraham. Then the rich man also died, and was buried:
\v 23 and in hell, lifting up his eyes, being in torments, he seeth Abraham at a vast distance, and Lazarus in his bosom.
\v 24 And crying out, he said, Father Abraham, have compassion on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented with this flame.
\v 25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou hast received thy good things during thy life, and Lazarus, in like manner, what was afflictive: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
\v 26 And besides all these considerations, between us and you there is a vast chasm fixed: so that they who might be willing to pass from hence to you, cannot; neither can they pass through to us, from thence.
\v 27 And he said, I entreat thee then, father, that thou wouldest send him to my paternal mansion:
\v 28 for I have five brothers: that he may testify to them, that they also come not into this place of torment.
\v 29 Abraham saith to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hearken to them.
\v 30 But he said, Ah no, father Abraham! but if one came to them from the dead, they will repent.
\v 31 Then he said to him, If they hearken not to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead.
\c 17
\cl CHAP. XVII.
\p
\v 1 THEN he said to his disciples, It is impossible that offences should not come; but wo to him through whom they come!
\v 2 It would be advantageous for him, if a milstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea, rather than offend one of these little ones.
\v 3 Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother sin against thee, reprove him; and if he repent, forgive him.
\v 4 And if seven times in the day he sin against thee, and seven times in the day return to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
\p
\v 5 And the disciples said unto the Lord, increase our faith.
\v 6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard, ye might say to that sycamore-tree, Be rooted up, and be planted in the sea; and it would obey you.
\p
\v 7 But which of you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, when he cometh from the field, will say immediately, Come, sit down at table?
\v 8 And will he not rather say, Prepare for me to sup, and gird thyself, and wait upon me, till I eat and drink; and after that, thou shalt eat and drink thyself?
\v 9 Doth he hold it as a favour from that servant, that he did the things which were ordered him? I think not.
\v 10 So also ye, when ye have done all things commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: for we have but done what was our duty to do.
\p
\v 11 And it came to pass, as he was going towards Jerusalem, he passed also through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
\v 12 And as he was entering a certain village, ten leprous men met him, who stood at a distance:
\v 13 and they lift up their voice, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!
\v 14 And looking towards them, he said, Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that as they were on the road, they were made clean.
\v 15 Then one of them, seeing that he was cured, returned, and with a loud voice gave glory to God,
\v 16 and fell prostrate at his feet giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
\v 17 Then Jesus spake and said, were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?
\v 18 There are none found returning to give glory to God, but this alien.
\v 19 And he said to him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath saved thee.
\p
\v 20 And being asked by one of the Pharisees, When cometh the kingdom of God? he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:
\v 21 neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
\v 22 Then said he to the disciples, The days will come when ye shall eagerly desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it.
\v 23 And they will say to you, Lo here! and lo there! go not after them, nor follow them.
\v 24 For as the lightning flashing from one quarter under heaven, shineth to another quarter under heaven; so shall the Son of man also be at his day.
\v 25 But he must first suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.
\v 26 And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it also be in the days of the coming of the Son of man.
\v 27 They did eat, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the deluge came, and destroyed them all.
\p
\v 28 Even so, likewise, it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
\v 29 but the day Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.
\v 30 Just so will it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.
\v 31 In that day, let not the man who is upon the roof, and his goods in the house, go down to carry them away: and he that is in the field, in like manner, let him not return for any things behind him.
\v 32 Remember Lot’s wife.
\v 33 Whosoever seeketh to preserve his life shall lose it; and whosoever would lose it, shall preserve it.
\v 34 I tell you, in that night two shall be in the same bed; the one shall be seized, and the other dismissed. Two women shall be grinding together: the one shall be seized, and the other dismissed.
\v 35 Two shall be in the field; the one shall be seized, and the other dismissed.

\v 37 And they answering, said to him, Where, Lord? And he said, Wherever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.

\p
\v 1 THEN he spake also to them a parable, to shew that we ought to pray always, and not faint;
\v 2 saying, There was a certain judge in a particular city, having no fear of God, nor respect for man:
\v 3 and there was a certain widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, Do me justice against my adversary.
\v 4 And he would not for a long while: but after this he said, Though I fear not God, nor respect man;
\v 5 yet because this woman is so troublesome to me, I will do her justice, lest by her perpetual coming she stun me with her importunity,
\v 6 Then said the Lord, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
\v 7 And shall not God execute vengeance for his own elect, who cry out to him day and night, though he bear long with them?
\v 8 Yes, I tell you, that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, ah! shall he find faith on the earth?
\p
\v 9 Then he spake also this parable to certain persons, who had confidence in themselves, that they were righteous, and despised others:
\v 10 Two men went up to the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, the other a tax-farmer.
\v 11 The Pharisee, standing by himself, made this prayer: God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of mankind, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or as this tax-gatherer.
\v 12 I keep a fast twice a week, I pay the tenth of all things I possess.
\v 13 And the tax-gatherer standing at a distance, would not even so much as lift his eyes heaven-ward, but smote on his breast, saying, May God accept the atonement for me a sinner!
\v 14 I say to you, Went this man down to his house justified, or the other? for every one who exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
\p
\v 15 Then they brought him infants also, that he should touch them: but the disciples, when they saw it, rebuked them.
\v 16 But Jesus calling them to him, said, Permit little children to come to me, and hinder them not for of such is the kingdom of God.
\v 17 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
\p
\v 18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, by doing what shall I inherit eternal life?
\v 19 Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good, but one, even God.
\p
\v 20 Thou knowest the commandments, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.
\v 21 Then he said, All these things have I observed from my youth.
\v 22 Then Jesus hearing this, said to him, Yet one thing thou lackest: sell all whatsoever thou hast, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
\v 23 But he, on hearing these things, was exceeding sorrowful: for he was very rich.
\v 24 Then Jesus, observing that he was very sorrowful, said, How difficultly shall they who have riches, enter into the kingdom of God!
\v 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
\v 26 And those who heard it said, Who then can be saved?
\v 27 And he said, The things impossible with men, are possible with God.
\v 28 Then said Peter, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
\v 29 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, that there is no man who hath left family, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
\v 30 who shall not receive back manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.
\p
\v 31 Then taking aside the twelve, he said to them, Lo, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things written by the prophets concerning the Son of man will be fulfilled.
\v 32 For he shall be delivered up to the Gentiles, and they shall insult him, and treat him with indignity, and spit upon him:
\v 33 and after scourging, shall slay him: and the third day he shall rise again.
\v 34 And they understood none of these things: and the saying was concealed from them, and they knew not the things which were spoken.
\p
\v 35 And it came to pass, as he drew nigh to Jerusalem, a certain blind man sat by the road-side begging:
\v 36 and hearing the multitude passing by, he inquired what was the cause.
\v 37 And they told him, that Jesus the Nazarean is going by.
\v 38 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me!
\v 39 And they who were going before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Son of David, have mercy on me!
\v 40 Then Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be brought to him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
\v 41 saying, What wist thou that I should do for thee? Then he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
\v 42 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.
\v 43 And instantly he received sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.

\v 1 AND entering into Jericho, he passed through.
\v 2 And there was a person whose name was Zaccheus, and he was a principal farmer of the taxes, and the man was rich.
\v 3 And he was desirous to have a sight of Jesus, what sort of person he was; and he could not, because of the crowd, for he was short of stature.
\v 4 So running before, he climbed up a sycamore-tree, in order to get a sight of him: for he was about to pass that way.
\v 5 And when he was come to the spot, Jesus looking up, saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, come down speedily; for to-day I must abide at thy house.
\v 6 And he hastened to come down, and entertained him gladly.
\v 7 And when they all saw it, they murmured, saying, That he is gone to lodge with a man, a notorious sinner.
\v 8 Then Zaccheus standing up, said unto the Lord, Behold, the half of my goods, Lord, I give unto the poor; and if I have got any thing from any man, by laying false informations, I am ready to restore fourfold.
\v 9 Then said Jesus unto him, To-day is salvation come to this house, because that he also is a son of Abraham.
\v 10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
\p
\v 11 And as they were hearkening to these things, he proceeded on, and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and they supposed that immediately the kingdom of God would openly appear.
\v 12 He said therefore, A certain man of noble family went into a distant region, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
\v 13 And calling his ten servants, he gave them ten manehs\f + \ft Equal to sixty shekels, above seven of our pounds.\f*, and said unto them, Employ yourselves in traffic, till I come back.
\v 14 But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not have this man to rule over us.
\v 15 And it came to pass, at his return, after receiving the kingdom, that he ordered the servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know what every one had gained by his traffic.
\v 16 Then came the first, and said, Sir, thy maneh has gained ten manehs.
\v 17 And he said unto him, Well done, good servant: because thou hast been faithful in the least matter, hold thou dominion over ten cities.
\v 18 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy maneh hath gained five manehs.
\v 19 Then said he also to this man, Be thou also over five cities.
\v 20 And another came, saying, Master, there is thy maneh, which I have kept wrapt up in a napkin:
\v 21 for I was afraid of thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up where thou hadst laid nothing down, and reapest where thou didst not sow.
\v 22 And he said to him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow;
\v 23 why then gavest thou not my money to the bank, so when I came I might have required it with interest?
\v 24 And he said to those who stood by, Take from him the maneh, and give it to him who hath the ten manehs.
\v 25 (And they say unto him, Sir, he hath ten manehs.)
\v 26 For I say unto you, That to every one who hath, shall more be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.
\v 27 But as for these enemies of mine, who would not that I should reign over them, bring them hither, and slay them before me.
\p
\v 28 And having thus spoken, he proceeded forward, going up to Jerusalem.
\v 29 And it came to pass, as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
\v 30 saying, Go into the opposite village; in which, as ye are at the entrance, ye will find a foal tied, on which no man hath ever yet sat: loose, and bring him.
\v 31 And if any man ask you, Why ye loose it? thus shall ye say to him, That the Lord hath need of him.
\v 32 Then they who were sent, going, found it just as he had described to them.
\v 33 And as they were untying the foal, the owners of it said to them, Why loose ye the foal?
\v 34 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.
\v 35 And they brought him to Jesus: and throwing their cloaks on the foal, they set Jesus thereon.
\v 36 And as he went, they spread under him their garments on the road.
\v 37 And when he was now approaching, at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples rejoicing began to praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen;
\v 38 saying, Blessed is the King, who cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
\p
\v 39 And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said unto him, Master, reprove thy disciples.
\v 40 And he replying said to them. I tell you that, should these be silent, the very stones would cry out.
\p
\v 41 And as he drew near, beholding the city, he wept over it,
\v 42 saying, Oh that thou hadst known, even in this thy day, the things that are for thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.
\v 43 For the days will come upon thee, when thy enemies shall cast up a trench around thee, and encircle thee about, and straiten thee on every side,
\v 44 and will dash thee on the ground, and thy children within thee; and will not leave in thee one stone upon another: because thou knewest not the season of thy visitation.
\p
\v 45 And entering into the temple, he began to cast out those who sold and bought in the temple;
\v 46 saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer\x + \xt Isaiah, lvi. 7.\x*: but ye have made it a den of robbers.
\p
\v 47 And he continued daily teaching in the temple. Then the chief priests and the scribes sought to destroy him, with the heads of the people,
\v 48 but did not discover how they could do any thing: for all the people attentively hung on his lips.

\p
\v 1 AND it came to pass, on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and scribes with the elders came upon him,
\v 2 and spake to him, saying, Tell us by what authority thou doest these things or who is he that giveth thee this authority?
\v 3 Then he answering said to them, I also will ask you one question; and resolve me:
\v 4 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?
\v 5 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we reply, From heaven; he will say, Wherefore then did ye not believe him?
\v 6 But if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
\v 7 And they answered, We know not from whence.
\v 8 And Jesus said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
\p
\v 9 Then he began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard, and delivered it to husbandmen, and went abroad for a long while.
\v 10 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that they might give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat, and sent him away empty.
\v 11 And he again sent another servant: and him also they beat, and treating him with indignity, sent him away empty.
\v 12 And he sent yet a third: and him they also wounded, and cast out.
\v 13 Then said the master of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: probably when they see him, they will shew him respect.
\v 14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be our own.
\v 15 So casting him out of the vineyard, they slew him. What then will the master of the vineyard do with these men?
\v 16 He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said God forbid.
\v 17 Then he looked on them, and said, What is this then which is written\x + \xt Psalm cxviii. 22.\x*, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?
\v 18 Every one who falleth upon this stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
\v 19 And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him at that time; and were afraid of the people: for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them.
\p
\v 20 And watching him, they sent men they had suborned, who pretended that they were righteous persons, in order to lay hold of some word of his, that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.
\v 21 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou speakest and teachest rightly, and respectest no man’s person, but teachest the way of God in truth:
\v 22 Is it lawful for us to pay tribute to Caesar, or not?
\v 23 Then he, aware of their crafty design, said unto them, Why tempt ye me?
\v 24 Shew me a denarius. Whose image and inscription hath it? And they answering said, Caesar’s.
\v 25 Then said he to them, Pay therefore to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and to God the things which are God’s.
\v 26 And they were unable to lay hold of a single expression of his before the people: and marvelling at his answer, they were silenced.
\p
\v 27 Then certain of the Sadducees, who contend that there is no resurrection, asked him,
\v 28 saying, Master, Moses wrote for us\x + \xt Deut. xxv. 5.\x*, If a man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die childless, that his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed for his brother.
\v 29 Now there were seven brothers: and the first taking a wife, died childless.
\v 30 And the second taking the wife, he also died childless.
\v 31 Then the third took her; and also all the seven in like manner: and left no children, and died.
\v 32 And last of all died also the woman.
\v 33 In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her to wife.
\v 34 And Jesus in reply said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:
\v 35 but they who are counted worthy to attain to that world, and the resurrection of the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
\v 36 neither can they die any more: for they are like the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
\v 37 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses intimated at the bush\x + \xt Exod. iii. 6.\x*, when he called the Lord, “the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.”
\v 38 Now God is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live with him.
\v 39 Then some of the scribes addressing him said, Master, admirably hast thou spoken!
\v 40 And after that they durst not put another question to him.
\p
\v 41 Then he spake to them: How say they that the Messiah is the son of David?
\v 42 Yet David himself, in the book of Psalms, saith, “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit down at my right hand,
\v 43 until I put thine enemies for a footstool of thy feet\x + \xt Psalm cx. 1.\x*.”
\v 44 David then calleth him Lord, and how then is he his son?
\p
\v 45 And whilst all the people were hearkening, he said to his disciples,
\v 46 Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk about in trailing robes, and love salutations in the public places, and the principal seats in the synagogues, and the most honourable couch at suppers;
\v 47 who devour the houses of widows, and for a pretext make long prayers: these shall receive a more abundant punishment.

\p
\v 1 AND as he looked up, he saw some casting their gifts into the treasury who were rich.
\v 2 And he observed also a certain widow, miserably poor, put in there two mites.
\v 3 And he said, Of a truth I tell you that this poor widow hath put in more than all they:
\v 4 for all they have of their superfluity cast into the oblations for God: but she out of her indigence hath cast in all the substance which she possessed.
\p
\v 5 And some of them talking of the temple, how adorned it was with the beautiful stone-work and the dedicated offerings, he said,
\v 6 As for these things which ye are gazing upon, the days will come, in which one stone will not be left upon another, that shall not be utterly thrown down.
\v 7 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what is the sign, when these things are ready to come to pass?
\v 8 Then he said, Take heed that ye be not deluded: for many will come in my name, saying, I am he; and the period approaches: go not therefore after them.
\v 9 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the conclusion is not immediately.
\v 10 Then saith he unto them, Nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
\v 11 and great earthquakes shall be in different places, and famines, and pestilences; and in the heaven shall be frightful appearances, and mighty signs.
\v 12 But before all these things, they will lay hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and to prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake.
\v 13 And it shall afford you an opportunity to bear your testimony.
\v 14 Therefore rest satisfied in your hearts, not to premeditate what apology to make:
\v 15 for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall be utterly unable to contradict or resist.
\v 16 But ye shall be betrayed even by parents, and brethren, and relations, and friends; and some of you they shall put to death.
\v 17 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.
\v 18 Though a hair of your head shall in nowise perish.
\v 19 In your patience possess ye your souls.
\v 20 But when ye see Jerusalem, encircled with armies, then know that the desolation of it approaches.
\v 21 Then let those who are in Judea fly unto the mountains; and let those who are in the midst of her get far away: and they who are in the countries, let them not enter into her.
\v 22 For these are the days of vengeance, when all things which are written shall be fulfilled.
\v 23 But wo to those who are big with child, and have infants at their breasts, in those days! for there shall be great distress on the earth, and wrath upon this people.
\v 24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden under foot of the Gentiles, until the times appointed for the Gentiles shall come to their period.
\v 25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
\v 26 men terrified to death with fear, and expectation of the calamities coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
\v 27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with power and great glory.
\v 28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.
\p
\v 29 And he spake a parable unto them, Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees,
\v 30 when they now put forth, as soon as ye see it ye know in yourselves that the summer is now near:
\v 31 so ye also, when ye see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is at hand.
\v 32 Verily I say unto you, That this generation shall in nowise pass away, until all these things come to pass.
\v 33 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall never pass away.
\v 34 But take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts should be overloaded with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the anxious cares of life, and that day should come upon you unawares.
\v 35 For as a snare shall it come upon all that are settled on the face of the whole earth.
\v 36 Watch therefore, praying at every proper opportunity, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things which are ready to come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
\p
\v 37 And during the day he continued teaching in the temple; but at night he went out, and lodged in the mountain called the mount of Olives.
\v 38 And all the people came to him early in the morning at the temple, to hear him.
\c 22
\cl CHAP. XXII.
\p
\v 1 AND the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was at hand.
\v 2 And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might destroy him; for they were afraid of the people.
\v 3 Then entered Satan into Judas called Iscariot, though he was of the number of the twelve.
\v 4 And he went and conversed with the chief priests and the captains, by what means he could betray him unto them.
\v 5 And they were glad, and agreed with him to give him a sum of money.
\v 6 And he gave them his promise, and sought the favourable opportunity to betray him to them, in the absence of the multitude.
\p
\v 7 Then came the day of unleavened bread, on which the passover must be killed.
\v 8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go, prepare for us the passover, that we may eat it.
\v 9 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare it?
\v 10 And he said unto them, Lo! as you are at the entrance of the city, there will a man meet you, carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house whither he is going.
\v 11 And say to the master of that family, The teacher saith to thee, Where is the dining-room, in which I can eat the passover with my disciples?
\v 12 And he will shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
\v 13 And they going away, found it just as he had told them: and they made ready the passover.
\v 14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
\v 15 And he said unto them, With earnest desire have I longed to eat this passover with you before I suffer:
\v 16 for I tell you, that I will no more ever eat of it, until it shall be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
\v 17 And taking the cup, after having given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide among yourselves:
\v 18 for I say unto you, that I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God come.
\v 19 And taking a loaf, he gave thanks, and brake, and gave it to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: do this in remembrance of me.
\v 20 And the cup in like manner, after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
\v 21 But lo! the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me at the table.
\v 22 And the Son of man indeed goeth, as is decreed: but wo to that man by whom he is betrayed!
\v 23 And they began to question among themselves, who it could possibly be of them who should do this thing.
\p
\v 24 Now it came to pass, that there was also a contention among them, even which of them should be accounted to be the greatest.
\v 25 And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.
\v 26 But ye shall not act thus: but the superior among you, let him be as the junior; and he that presideth, as he that serveth.
\v 27 For which is the greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that waits? is not he that sitteth at table? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth.
\v 28 Ye are they who have continued with me during my trials.
\v 29 And I appoint you, as my Father hath appointed me, a kingdom;
\v 30 that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and be seated on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, lo! Satan hath earnestly sought you, that he might sift you as wheat:
\v 32 but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith may not fail: and when thou art returned, stablish thy brethren.
\v 33 Then he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, to prison, and to death!
\v 34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before thou shalt thrice deny having known me.
\p
\v 35 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, or scrip, or sandals, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.
\v 36 Then said he to them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him also take a scrip: and he that hath none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.
\v 37 For I tell you, that what hath already been written must be fulfilled in me, namely, “He was numbered with the transgressors\x + \xt Isa. liii. 12.\x*:” for the things also concerning me draw to their period.
\v 38 Then they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords, and he said to them, It is enough.
\p
\v 39 And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.
\v 40 And when he came to the spot, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
\v 41 And he withdrew from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeling down, he prayed,
\v 42 saying, Father, if thou wilt, remove this cup from me! nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done.
\v 43 And an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
\v 44 And being in an agony, he prayed with greater intenseness: and his sweat was as clots of blood falling on the ground.
\v 45 And when he rose up from prayer, on coming to his disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow.
\v 46 And he said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise up, and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.
\p
\v 47 And while he was yet speaking, behold a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and approached Jesus to kiss him.
\v 48 Then said Jesus unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
\v 49 Then when they who were about him saw what was ready to happen, they said unto him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?
\v 50 And one of them struck at a servant of the high-priest, and cut off his right ear.
\v 51 Then Jesus, addressing them, said, Permit me thus far: and touching his ear, he healed him.
\v 52 Then said Jesus to the chief priests and captains of the temple, and to the elders who were come forth against him, Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and staves?
\v 53 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched out no hands upon me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
\p
\v 54 Then seizing upon him, they led him away, and brought him into the palace of the high-priest. But Peter followed at a distance.
\v 55 And as they had lighted a fire in the middle of the hall, and had seated themselves in a company, Peter sat down in the midst of them.
\v 56 But a certain maid-servant who sat at the fire, eyeing him, and looking at him stedfastly, said, This man was also with him.
\v 57 But he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
\v 58 And after a little while another seeing him, said, Surely thou art one of them. Then said Peter, Man, I am not.
\v 59 And at about an hour’s distance, another person strongly asserted, saying, Of a certainty this fellow was also with him: for he too is a Galilean.
\v 60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And instantly, while he was yet speaking, the cock crew.
\v 61 And the Lord, turning round, looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, That before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
\v 62 And Peter going without, wept bitterly.
\p
\v 63 And the men who held Jesus insulted him, beating him with rods;
\v 64 and blindfolding him, smote him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is he that struck thee?
\v 65 And many other things, blaspheming, spake they against him.
\p
\v 66 And when the day broke, the elders of the people and the chief priests and scribes assembled, and brought him into their sanhedrim, saying,
\v 67 If thou art the Messiah, tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:
\v 68 and if I shall ask you any question, ye will neither answer me, nor let me go free.
\v 69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit at the right hand of the power of God.
\v 70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Yourselves say that I am.
\v 71 Then they said, What further need have we of witness? for we have heard it from his own mouth.
\c 23
\cl CHAP. XXIII.
\p
\v 1 AND the whole multitude of them rising up, led him to Pilate,
\v 2 and began to accuse him, saying, We have found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to pay tribute to Caesar; pretending that he himself is the King Messiah.
\v 3 Then Pilate interrogated him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said to him, Thou sayest so.
\v 4 Then said Pilate unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find nothing culpable in this man.
\v 5 But they were urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching through all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.
\v 6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean?
\v 7 And when he knew that he came out of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was himself at Jerusalem in those days.
\p
\v 8 Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was vastly delighted: for he had been long desirous to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some miracle wrought by him.
\v 9 And he put a variety of questions to him; but he made him no reply.
\v 10 And the chief priests and the scribes stood up vehemently accusing him.
\v 11 Then Herod with his guards treated him with contempt, and in derision clothed him in a splendid robe, and sent him back to Pilate.
\v 12 And Pilate and Herod the same day became friends together: for they had previously been at enmity with each other.
\p
\v 13 Then Pilate, convoking the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
\v 14 said unto them, Ye have brought this man to me, as one who perverteth the people: and lo! on examining him before you, I have found nothing culpable in this man, respecting the charges ye bring against him:
\v 15 nor Herod neither: for I referred you to him; and, lo, nothing is done to this man, as if he deserved death.
\v 16 I will therefore, after scourging, discharge him.
\v 17 (Now he held it necessary to release one to them at the feast.)
\v 18 Then the whole multitude set up a cry, saying, Away with this fellow, and release unto us Barabbas!
\v 19 (who for a certain sedition raised in the city, and for murder, had been cast into prison.)
\v 20 Again therefore Pilate called out to them, desirous to see Jesus at liberty.
\v 21 But they clamoured the more, saying, Crucify, crucify him.
\v 22 Then the third time he said to them, What evil hath this man done? I have found nothing deserving death in him: I will therefore, after scourging, discharge him.
\v 23 But they were instant with the most clamorous vociferations, soliciting that he might be crucified. And their clamours, and those of the chief priests, bore him down.
\v 24 Then Pilate decreed that their petition should be granted.
\p
\v 25 Then released he to them him who for sedition and murder had been cast into prison; but he gave up Jesus to their will.
\v 26 And as they led him out, laying hold on one Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, they laid on him the cross, to carry after Jesus.
\v 27 And a great multitude of the people and of women followed him, who also beat their breasts and lamented him bitterly.
\v 28 But Jesus turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but for yourselves, and for your children.
\v 29 For, behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs which have not borne, and the breasts which never suckled.
\v 30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! and to the hills, Cover us!
\v 31 For if they do all these things with the green wood, what will be done with the dry?
\p
\v 32 Now there were two other persons, malefactors, led out with him to be executed.
\v 33 And when they came to a place called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, the one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
\v 34 And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. Then dividing his garments, they cast the lot.
\p
\v 35 And the people stood looking on. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this fellow is the Messiah, the elect of God.
\v 36 And the soldiers also insulted him, coming and offering him vinegar,
\v 37 and saying, if thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.
\v 38 And there was an inscription written over him in Greek, Roman, and Hebrew characters, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\p
\v 39 Then one of the suspended malefactors blasphemed him, saying, If thou art the Messiah, save thyself and us.
\v 40 But the other addressing him, rebuked him, saying, Hast thou no fear of God, when thou art under the same condemnation?
\v 41 And we indeed justly, for we receive deserved punishment for the crimes we have committed: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
\v 42 And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou comest in thy kingdom.
\v 43 And Jesus said to him. Verily I say unto thee, To-day thou shalt be with me in paradise.
\p
\v 44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
\v 45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
\v 46 And Jesus crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit: and having said this, he expired.
\v 47 And the centurion observing what had come to pass, glorified God, saying, Verily this man was a righteous person.
\p
\v 48 And all the multitudes who had come together for this spectacle, when they saw the things which were done, beating their breasts, returned.
\v 49 And all his acquaintance stood afar off, and the women which followed him from Galilee, beholding these things.
\p
\v 50 And lo! a man named Joseph, being a member of the council, a good man, and a just;
\v 51 (who had not given his assent to their determination and deed;) being of Arimathea, a city of the Jews: who himself also expected the coming of the kingdom of God.
\v 52 He went in to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
\v 53 And taking it down from the cross, he wrapped it in linen cloth, and laid it in a sepulchre hewn out of a rock, where none had ever yet lain.
\v 54 And that was the preparation-day, and the sabbath’s twilight\f + \ft Their day commenced at sun-set.\f* was approaching.
\p
\v 55 Then the women also, his attendants, who had followed him out of Galilee, observed the sepulchre, and how his corpse was laid out.
\v 56 And returning, they made preparation of aromatics and unguents; and they rested the sabbath-day, according to the commandment.
\c 24
\cl CHAP. XXIV.
\p
\v 1 NOW on the first day of the week, at the earliest dawn of day, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the aromatics which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
\v 2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
\v 3 And on entering, found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
\v 4 And it came to pass, as they were in the greatest perplexity concerning this matter, then behold, two men stood by them in refulgent garments:
\v 5 and when they were exceedingly terrified, and inclined their face to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
\v 6 he is not here; he is risen: remember how he spoke to you, while he was yet in Galilee,
\v 7 saying, That the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
\v 8 And they remembered his declarations,
\v 9 and returning from the sepulchre, told all these things to the eleven, and to the rest.
\v 10 Now there were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women who were with them, that told these things to the apostles.
\v 11 And their declarations seemed in their view as a mere fancy, and they gave them no credence.
\v 12 Then Peter rising up, ran off to the sepulchre, and leaning forward saw the linen clothes laid separately, and went away wondering in himself what was become of him.
\p
\v 13 And behold, two of them were going the same day to a village, distant about sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, called Emmaus.
\v 14 And they were conversing with each other, concerning all those things which had happened.
\v 15 And it came to pass, as they were conversing together, and talking the matter over, even Jesus himself drew near, and walked on with them.
\v 16 But their eyes were under a restraint, that they might not discover him.
\v 17 And he said unto them, What are these discourses that ye interchange among you, as ye are walking, and bear such a face of dejection?
\v 18 Then one of them, named Cleopas, answering said, Art thou the only sojourner at Jerusalem, who hath not known the singular events of those days?
\v 19 And he said to them, Of what sort? and they said to him, Those which relate to Jesus the Nazarean, who was a man, a prophet, mighty in word and deed before God and all the people:
\v 20 and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to a sentence of death, and crucified him.
\v 21 But we had entertained hopes that this was the person who should have redeemed Israel: and ah! besides all these things, to-day concludes that third day since these things were done.
\v 22 And indeed, certain women belonging to us exceedingly amazed us who were very early at the sepulchre;
\v 23 and not finding his body, came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who told them that he was alive.
\v 24 And some of those who were with us went to the sepulchre, and found every thing just as the women had said: but him they did not see.
\v 25 And he said unto them, O ye void of understanding, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
\v 26 Ought not the Messiah to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?
\v 27 And beginning from Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them in all the scriptures, the things relating to himself.
\v 28 And they drew nigh to the village, whither they were going: and he was proceeding on, as if going farther.
\v 29 And they warmly pressed him, saying, Stay with us: for the evening draws on, and the day declines. And he went in to stay with them.
\v 30 And it came to pass, when he was sitting down at table with them, taking up a loaf, he blessed it, and breaking, distributed it to them.
\v 31 Then their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he became invisible to them.
\v 32 And they said to each other, Did not our hearts burn within us, as he talked with us on the road, and as he distinctly opened to us the scriptures?
\v 33 And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those who were with them crowded together,
\v 34 saying, The Lord is risen assuredly, and hath appeared to Simon.
\v 35 Then these recounted what had passed on the road, and how he was known to them by the breaking of the bread.
\p
\v 36 While they were relating these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you!
\v 37 But terrified and affrighted, they thought they saw a spirit.
\v 38 And he said to them, Why are ye under such agitation of mind? and why do reasonings arise in your hearts?
\v 39 look upon my hands and my feet, that it is my very self: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
\v 40 And thus speaking, he exposed to them his hands and his feet.
\v 41 But when they still could not credit it for joy, and marvelled, he said unto them, Have ye here any thing eatable?
\v 42 Then they gave him a part of a broiled fish, and a piece of honey-comb.
\v 43 And receiving it, he did eat in their presence.
\v 44 And said unto them, These are the sayings which I spake unto you, when I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me.
\v 45 Then opened he thoroughly their understanding, that they should understand the scriptures,
\v 46 and said to them, That thus it is written, and thus must the Messiah suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day
\v 47 and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name unto all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
\v 48 And ye are the witnesses of these things.
\v 49 And, behold, I send unto you the promise of my Father: but sit ye down in the city of Jerusalem, until ye shall be endued with power from on high.
\v 50 And he led them without \add the city\add* as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them.
\v 51 And it came to pass, as he pronounced the benediction upon them, he was parted from them, and taken up into heaven.
\v 52 And they, after paying him their adorations, returned to Jerusalem with vast joy:
\v 53 and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
