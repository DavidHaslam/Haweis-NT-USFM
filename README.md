# Haweis-NT-USFM
Thomas Haweis 1795 New Testament converted from the Gutenberg text to USFM.

## Thomas Haweis ##
The translator was Rector of All-Saints, Aldwinckle, Northamptonshire; and Chaplain to the late Countess of Huntingdon.

For further background, please refer to [Thomas Haweis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Haweis).

## Status ##
The set of 27 USFM files has been uploaded.

NB. The cross-reference notes use lowercase Roman numerals for chapter numbers.

## Purpose ##
Now the set of USFM files is ready, I will use adyeths/u2o.py script to convert the work to OSIS.

The plan is to create a SWORD module for distribution by the CrossWire Bible Society.

## Copyright ##
The Haweis 1795 NT is public domain.
