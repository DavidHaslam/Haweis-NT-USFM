# Haweis-NT-USFM
Thomas Haweis 1795 New Testament converted to USFM.

## Thomas Haweis ##
The translator was Rector of All-Saints, Aldwinckle, Northamptonshire; and Chaplain to the late Countess of Huntingdon.

For further background, please refer to [Thomas Haweis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Haweis).

## Status ##
Work in progress (substantially complete) but USFM files are not yet uploaded.

## Purpose ##
Once the set of USFM files is ready, I will use adyeths/u2o.py script to convert the work to OSIS.

Then the plan is to create a SWORD module for distribution by the CrossWire Bible Society.

## Copyright ##
The Haweis 1795 NT is public domain.
