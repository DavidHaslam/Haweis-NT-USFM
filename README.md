# Haweis-NT-USFM
Thomas Haweis 1795 New Testament converted to USFM.

## Status ##
Work in progress (substantially complete) but USFM files are not yet uploaded.

## Purpose ##
Once the set of USFM files is ready, I will use adyeths/u2o.py script to convert the work to OSIS.
Then the plan is to create a SWORD module for distribution by the CrossWire Bible Society.

## Copyright ##
The Haweis 1795 NT is public domain.
